== ExchangeHandler Chains
Communications between components and bindings to/from components is done by a LocalExchangeBus.

NOTE: This is the wire

There is a chain of ExchangeHandlers acting as interceptors for the request and response pipelines of the wire. The default chain has the following:

* *RequestChain*
** *addressing*: AddressingHandler resolves service instances based on a service reference.
** *transaction-pre-invoke*: TransactionHandler interprets transactional policy specified on an exchange and handles transactional requirements. Suspends current transaction and creates a new one, creates a new one, join an ongoing transaction,...
** *security-process*:  SecurityHandler interprets security policy specified on an exchange and handles security requirements. Cretes the SecurityContext and SecurityProvider and attaches to the thread.
** *generic-policy*: PolicyHandler
** *validation-before-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the Exchange`s content type.
** *transformation*: TransformHandler applies all the defined transformations (*org.switchyard.transform.Transformer*) for the message for consumer.inputType to provider.inputType and set the Exchange's new content type.
** *validation-after-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the new Exchange`s content type.
** *provider*: ProviderHandler dispatches the message to the provider (component).
** *security-cleanup*: SecurityHandler cleanup of context and thread info.
** *transaction-post-invoke*: TransactionHandler commits or rollback, or resume suspended transaction,...

NOTE: Only IN_OUT Exchanges will execute the ReplyChain, that's why there are 2 Handlers after the execution of the provider, to cleanup/finish tasks.
        
* *ReplyChain*
** *validation-before-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the Exchange`s content type.
** *transformation*: TransformHandler applies all the defined transformations (*org.switchyard.transform.Transformer*) for the message for provider.outputType to consumer.outputType and set the Exchange's new content type.
** *validation-after-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the new Exchange`s content type.
** *HandlerChain.CONSUMER_HANDLER*: BaseHandler
