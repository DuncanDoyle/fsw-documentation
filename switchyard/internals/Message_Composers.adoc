== Message composition
It is the process of converting the Message from the binding format (HTTP request, SOAP envelope, JMS message, File, ...) to a SwitchYard message, and mapping the context 
information from the binding format (HTTP headers, SOAP headers, JMS headers, ...) to the SwitchYard Context, and from the Switchyard internal format (message and context)
back again into the binding format.

== Message Composition Explained with an example
For this article, there is some sample code here:

* link:https://github.com/jorgemoralespou/fsw-documentation/tree/master/demos/switchyard/switchyard-quickstart-http-proxy[Quickstart-http-proxy]

=== HTTP Message flow in Http Gateway
Here we will find a description of what is happening at the message composition time in a call to a SwitchYard application through an HTTP binding and having one call to an external reference through an HTTP binding.

== (1) Request message from binding to service
The request message is converted from the binding message type to the internal service type. For this to happen, a call to *HttpMessageComposer.compose()*.

In this method two things will happen:

* It will create a *Message* for the *Exchange*.

* A call to *HttpContextMapper.mapFrom(HttpRequestBindingData, context)* will be done. This method will:

** It will copy *requestInfo* from the *HTTPRequestBindingData* into the message *Context* with key *HttpComposition.HTTP_REQUEST_INFO* and assigning the following labels, *ComponentLabel.HTTP* and *EndpointLabel.HTTP*

NOTE: HttpRequestInfo has all the required information from the request, and is the source of information that can be used in the SwitchYard's component implementations to access information relative to the request, such as requestURI, requestPath, method, contextPath,... link:https://github.com/jboss-switchyard/components/blob/master/http/src/main/java/org/switchyard/component/http/composer/HttpRequestInfo.java#L35-L56[See the implementation of this class to find all the available information].

** It will copy all headers from the HTTP request that match the defined includes and exludes regex pattern for the composer at design time.

NOTE: Headers are not automatically copied, you have to add to messageComposer which headers you want to include (.*: all)

image::message_composition/MessageComposer_Configuration.png[Message Composer Configuration]

WARNING: When checking for headers, or defining headers in Binding's RegEx Inclusion and Exclusion, all headers are *lowercased*. If you send a header *Authorization*, you should check for *authorization* instead.

* It will copy the content from the *HttpBindingData* to the *Message* that will flow through SwitchYard converting it to the appropiate type.

* It will return the *Message*.

== (2) Service component implementations execution
The request pipelines of a component will be executed, until a there is a call to an external HTTP service.

== (3) Request message from reference to binding
A call to the external service is about to happen, and message needs to be converted from SwitchYard message to the reference binding data.

* A call to *HttpMessageComposer.decompose(Exchange, HttpRequestBindingData)* will be done. This method will:
** Copies the content from the *Exchange* to the content *HttpRequestBindingData*
** Calls *HttpContextMapper.mapTo(Request)* to copy headers from the Message`s *Context* to the HttpRequestBindingData's http headers. These properties will be copied only if they match the registered regexp expressions in the MessageComposer's design time configuration or if the properties are marked with the EndpointLabel.HTTP label in the Context.


== (4) Response message from binding to reference
Once the external service has being executed, we have to deal with the response from this external service, and map it back into SwitchYard. To to this, a call to *HttpMessageComposer.compose(HttpResponseBindingData, Exchange) will be done. This method will:

* Create a Message

* Call *HttpContextMapper.mapFrom(HttpResponseBindingData, Message)* that will:
** Copies the statusCode of the invocation into a Context property called *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* with labels http (ComponentLabel.HTTP and EnpointLabel.HTTP)
** It will copy all headers from the HTTP response that match the defined includes and exludes regex pattern for the composer at design time.

NOTE: Headers are not automatically copied, you have to add to messageComposer which headers you want to include (.*: all)

* It will copy the content from the *HttpBindingData* to the *Message* that will flow through SwitchYard converting it to the appropiate type.

* It will return the *Message*.

== (5) Service execution
The rest of the components` pipeline will be executed.

== (6) Response message from service to binding
When our application has ended it's execution and it is returning the result to the caller, it will call again *HttpMessageComposer.decompose(Exchange, HttpResponseBindingData)* to convert the SwitchYard message to the binding message or content.
It will:
* Get statusCode from Context property *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* that has been established as part of the SwitchYard service execution.

NOTE: This property could be the one that was set from the invocation to the external Composite's Reference. (In step 4)

- If there is no statusCode set as a property, or this statusCode property does not have the *EndpointLabel.HTTP*  label, it will calculate one depending on the content and on the *Exchange.getState*. If the state of the Exchange is *ExchangeState.FAULT* it will return an HTTP Error code of *500*. (link:https://github.com/jboss-switchyard/components/blob/master/http/src/main/java/org/switchyard/component/http/composer/HttpMessageComposer.java#L73-L88[See the code for the logic determining the statusCode])
* Copy the content from the SwitchYard's *Message* to the *HttpResponseBindingData*
* Call HttpContextMapper.mapTo(HttpResponseBindingData) that will:
** Copy headers from the Message`s *Context* to the HttpRequestBindingData's http headers. These properties will be copied only if they match the registered regexp expressions in the MessageComposer's design time configuration or if the properties are marked with the EndpointLabel.HTTP label in the Context.
** If the property is *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* it will set the status on the HttpResponseBindingData
