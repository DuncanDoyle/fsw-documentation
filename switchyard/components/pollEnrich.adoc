== How to read a file programatically
I've been asked recently how to read a file programatically, based on a cron, or when a request is made via a call to a Service.
I didn't have an answer, well, really I had an answer and I was wrong. Today, somebody brought the topic back, and I revisited the
problem, and now I have an answer, one that works, so a good answer.

== Problem description
I have the following use case: 

A file should be downloaded by FTP from a remote server. The download of the file can be triggered in two ways:

* by a scheduler whose polling interval may be changed at runtime
* by a HTTP GET Request on a specified url. The response of the HTTP call must include transformed data based on the downloaded file.
 
What is a good way to achieve these requirements with SY/Camel? I would like to use the bindings provided by Camel, but have no idea how they can be triggered (e.g. the FTP binding) from outside the binding.

== Solution
I have created a sample project, just to demonstrate how it works, not the full problem is solved. You have to use the http://camel.apache.org/content-enricher.html[content ennricher EIP].

We have a service, with a scheduled binding (Every 30 secs) that calls a Camel component. In this component, we use pollEnrich to read a file, and the use the contents of the 
file (the Message) to write into a File (a Reference with file binding).

This is the route we will be using. *Note the pollEnrich to read the file.*

[source,java]
----
	public void configure() {
		from("switchyard://ProgramaticReload")
		.log("Going to read the file")
		.pollEnrich("file:///input?fileName=in.txt",1000)
		.log("Received message for 'ProgramaticReload' : ${body}")
		.to("switchyard://FileWriterService");
	}
