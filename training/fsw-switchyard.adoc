== SwitchYard - SCA

____
SwitchYard is a component-based *development framework* focused on building *structured*, *maintainable services* and *applications* using the concepts and best practices of SOA. It works with Apache Camel to provide a *fast*, *simple*, *flexible* integration runtime with *comprehensive* connectivity and transports. A *uniform* application model *augments* Apache Camel, *joining* Java EE, BPM, rules, orchestration, and routing into a *cohesive* development model and runtime. 

Common functionality and cross-cutting concerns - validation, transformation and policy - are isolated from business logic and handled declaratively. This ensures *consistency* and *eliminates duplication*, offering developers a clear view of the structure and relationships of services in an integration application.

== SwitchYard - SCA

image::switchyard/sca/app.jpg[SwitchYard application]

== Composite
A composite is displayed as a light blue rectangle and represents the boundary between what's inside your application and what's outside your application. A SwitchYard application consists of exactly one composite that has a name and a targetNamespace. The targetNamespace value is important as it allows names defined locally in the application (e.g. service names) to be qualified and unique within a SwitchYard runtime.

== Composite
image::switchyard/sca/composite.jpg[composite]

[source,xml]
----
<sca:composite name="example" targetNamespace="urn:example:switchyard:1.0">
</sca:composite>
----

== Component
A component is a modular container for application logic and consists of the following:

* 0 or 1 component service definitions
* 0 to many component reference definitions
* 1 implementation

Services and references allow a component to interact with other components, while the implementation provides the actual logic for providing and/or consuming services.

== Component
image::switchyard/sca/component.jpg[component]

[source,xml]
----
<sca:component name="Routing">
</sca:component>
----

== Implementation
An implementation acts as the 'brain' of a service component and it is how implement your application logic. The following implementation options are available:

* *Bean*: allows a CDI Bean to consume or provide services using annotations.
* *Camel*: EIP-style routing and service composition using the XML or Java DSL in Apache Camel.
* *BPMN 2*: service orchestration integration expressed as BPMN 2 and executed using jBPM.
* *BPEL Process*: web service orchestration using the OASIS Business Process Execution Language.
* *Rules*: decision services based on Drools.

Implementations are private to a component, which means external consumers and providers are not aware of the details of a component's implementation (implementation-hiding).  All interactions with other components within an application and with external services are handled through component services and references.

== Implementation
image::switchyard/sca/implementations.jpg[implementation]

----
<sca:component name="Routing">
   <camel:implementation.camel>
      <camel:xml path="RoutingService.xml"/>
   </camel:implementation.camel>
</sca:component>
----

== Component Service
A component service is used to expose the functionality of an implementation as a service. All component services have a contract, which can be a Java interface, WSDL portType definition, or a set of named data types (interface.esb). Component services are private to an application, which means a component service can only be invoked by other components in the same application. In order to expose a component service to consumers external to the application, a component service can be 'promoted' to a composite service. A component service can be promoted multiple times to create different composite services.

      <sca:interface.java interface="org.example.ServiceA"/>
   </sca:service>
</sca:component>
----

== Composite Service
A composite service represents an application service which is visible to other applications. A composite service can only be realized by promoting a component service within the application. The name and the interface of the composite service can be different from the component service. If the interface, or contract, of the composite service is different from the component service, be aware that a transformation may be required to map between the types defined in each interface. In our example application, the component service has a Java interface while the composite service has a WSDL interface. This means we would need to declare a transformer which maps between XML and Java to resolve the data type mismatch.

      <sca:interface.wsdl interface="ServiceA.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(ServiceAPortType)"/>
   </sca:service>
</sca:composite>
----

== Service Binding
A service binding is used to define an access method for a composite service. Composite services can have multiple bindings, which allows a single service to be accessed in different ways. In most cases, a service binding represents a protocol/transport adapter (e.g. SOAP, JMS, REST). An important exception to this rule is the SCA binding, which allows services across applications in the same runtime to be wired together in memory. Regardless of the underlying binding details, a binding must always be used to facilitate inter-application communication in SwitchYard.

        <soap:wsdl>ServiceA.wsdl</soap:wsdl>
      </soap:binding.soap>
   </sca:service>
</sca:composite>
----

== Component Reference
A component reference allows a component to consume other services. A component reference can be wired to a service offered by another component in the same application or it can be wired to services outside the application via a composite reference. Similar to component services, all component references have a contract with allows a component to invoke services without knowing implementation or binding details. The picture below shows an example of wiring a reference on the Routing component to a service offered by the Bean component.

   </sca:service>
   <sca:reference name="ServiceC">
      <sca:interface.java interface="org.example.ServiceC"/>
   </sca:reference>
</sca:component>
----

== Composite Reference
A composite reference allows a component reference to be wired to a service outside the application. Similar to composite services, bindings are used with composite references to specify the communication method for invoking the external service.

      <sca:interface.java interface="org.example.ServiceB"/>
   </sca:reference>
</sca:composite>
----

== Reference Bindings
A reference binding is used to define an access method for an external service via a composite reference. Unlike service bindings, there can only be one binding for each composite reference. The set of bindings available for references is identical to the set of bindings available for services, although the configuration values for a given binding may be different depending on whether it's used as a service binding or a reference binding.

== Contracts

Every service needs to have it's contract defined (API).

This contracts can be defined in one of 3 ways:

* Java 
* WSDL
* ESB

NOTE: SwitcyYard require a one parameter per method in the contract definition

== Java contract

.Definition and implementation
image::switchyard/contracts/esb_contract.png[ESB contract]

== Bean Component
The Bean Component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard which allows Java classes (or beans) to provide and consume services. This means that you can implement a service by simply annotating a Java class. It also means you can consume a service by injecting a reference to that service directly into your Java class

image::switchyard/components/bean/bean_component.png[Bean component]

== Creating a Bean service
To create a new Bean service you only need a few pieces of information:

* *Name*: the name of the Java class for your bean service.
* *Service Name*: the name of the service your bean will provide.
* *Interface*: the contract for the service being provided.  Java is the only valid interface type for bean services.

== Creating a Bean service
image::switchyard/components/bean/new-bean.jpg[New bean component]

== Creating a Bean service

[source,java]
----
package com.example.switchyard.docs;
 
import org.switchyard.component.bean.Service;
 
@Service(Example.class)
public class ExampleBean implements Example {
 
}
----

The @Service annotation allows the SwitchYard CDI Extension to discover your bean at runtime and register it as a service. The value of the annotatio represents the service contract for the service. 

 Every bean service must have an @Service annotation with a value identifying the service interface for the service.
 
== Consuming a Bean service
In addition to providing a service in SwitchYard, beans can also consume other services. These services can be provided in the same application by other implementations, or they could be wired to gateway bindings to invoke services over JMS, SOAP, FTP, etc. The SwitchYard runtime handles the resolution of the service reference to a concrete service, allowing your service logic to remain blissfully ignorant. Invocations made through this reference are routed through the SwitchYard exchange mechanism.

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference
private SimpleService service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.sayHello("Hello " + consumerName);
}
----

== Consuming a Bean service
By default, SwitchYard expects a service reference to be declared with a name which matches the Java type used for the reference. In the event where the service reference name is different from the type name of the contract, the @Reference annotation can accept a service name

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference("urn:com.example.services:SimpleService:1.0")
private SimpleService service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.sayHello("Hello " + consumerName);
}
----

== Consuming a Bean service

image::switchyard/components/bean/consume_service_3.png[]

== Consuming a Bean service

image::switchyard/components/bean/consume_service_4.png[]

== Reference Invoker
The default behavior of @Reference is to inject a reference using the Java interface of the reference contract. This is adequate for most cases, but it does not allow you to access SwitchYard API constructs like the Message and Context interfaces. 

If you need to access to an attachment or a context property when invoking a reference from a Bean service, then you will want to use a *ReferenceInvoker*. To use a ReferenceInvoker, all you need to do is _replace the service contract interface type with a ReferenceInvoker type and SwitchYard will automatically inject the correct instance_.

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference("urn:com.example.services:SimpleService:1.0")
private ReferenceInvoker service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.newInvocation("sayHello")
      .setProperty("myHeader", "myValue")
      .invoke(consumerName);
}
----

 Note how the ReferenceInvoker instance is used to create a ReferenceInvocation using the newInvocation() method. A new instance of ReferenceInvocation should be created each time you want to invoke a service using ReferenceInvoker.

== Camel Component
Camel services allow you to leverage the core routing engine inside of Apache Camel to route between services in SwitchYard. All of the EIP and core routing support in Camel is available to your service implementation. Each Camel route is exposed as a service within SwitchYard, which means it has a well-defined contract and can be injected into any other service in the runtime.

There are 2 implementations:

* Java DSL
* XML DSL

== Camel Component Tips

* There is only one route per service. (More routes can be created, only one component entry point)
* The consumer or "from" endpoint in a route is always a "switchyard" endpoint and the endpoint name must equal the service name.  This is default behavior in the tooling.
* To consume other services from within your route, only use "switchyard" consumer (i.e. "to") endpoints. This keeps your routing logic independent of the binding details for consumed services.

 These are tips and behaviour can be modify to NOT comply with above tips 

== Creating a Camel Service in Java DSL

image::switchyard/components/camel/new_camel_java_service.png[New Camel Java Service]

== Creating a Camel Service in Java DSL

[source,java]
----
package com.example.switchyard.docs;
 
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
 
public class CamelServiceRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    /**
     * The Camel route is configured via this method.  The from:
     * endpoint is required to be a SwitchYard service.
     */
    public void configure() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        from("switchyard://Example").log(
                "Received message for 'Example' : ${body}");
    }
}
----

 There are no SwitchYard-specific classes or APIs used for Java DSL route; the route class is identical in signature to what you would use with Apache Camel directly.

== Creating a Camel Service in XML DSL

image::switchyard/components/camel/new_camel_xml_service.png[New Camel XML Service]

== Creating a Camel Service in XML DSL

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?>
<route xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
   <from uri="switchyard://Example"/>
   <log message="Example - message received: ${body}"/>
</route>
----

 The XML routing syntax is identical to what you would use with Apache Camel directly and conforms to the Camel schema for <route> definition

== Drawbacks in Camel Service in XML DSL

NOTE: As of FSW 6.0 there is no access to Camel Context from within the route xml definition file, so it is not suitable for defining namespaces,... or anything that get's registered into the Camel Context.

== Consuming services from Camel routes
Invoking another service from within your Camel route can be done by using the SwitchYard producer endpoint (switchyard://) within your route.  Endpoint configuration is very straightforward:

[source,java]
----
switchyard://<service-name>[?operationName=<operation-name>]
----

* *service-name*: name of the SwitchYard service. This value needs to match the name of a service reference defined on the service component for the route.
* *operation-name*: name of the service operation to be invoked. This is only used on references and is optional if the target service only has a single operation.

image::switchyard/composite_overview.png[Composite overview]

== Scripting languages in Camel
Because of 3rd party dependencies, SwitchYard supports only following languages:

* BeanShell
* JavaScript
* Groovy
* Ruby
* Python

 Inside your script you will have access to predefined variables like request, response or exchange which will let you generate response.

[source,java]
----
public class ScriptingBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
 
    public void configure() {
        from("switchyard://Inbound")
            .filter().javaScript("request.getHeader('myHeader') != null")
                .to("switchyard://Outbound");
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
public class ScriptingImplementationBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
 
    public void configure() {
        from("switchyard://Inbound")
            .transform().groovy("classpath:script.groovy"); // classpath resource
 
        from("switchyard://InboundBsh")
            .transform().language("beanshell", "file:script.bsh"); // file system resource
    }
}
----

== Camel CDI Integration

SwitchYard integrates the CDI Bean Manager with the Camel Bean Registry to allow you to reference CDI Beans in your Camel routes. Any Java class annotated with @Named in your application will be available through Camel's Bean registry.

[source,java]
----
@Named("StringSupport")
@ApplicationScoped
public class StringUtil {
 
    public String trim(String string) {
        return string.trim();
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
 
    public void configure() {
        from("switchyard://ExampleBuilder")
            .split(body(String.class).tokenize("\n"))
            .filter(body(String.class).startsWith("sally:"))
            .to("bean:StringSupport");
    }
}
----

See http://camel.apache.org/bean-binding.html[Camel's Bean Binding] documentation for more details.

== Create a BPEL Component service
Once you have your WSDL interface for the BPEL service, add the component to the SwitchYard configuration (create or define the implementation and service interface).

image::switchyard/components/bpel/new_bpel_service_1.png[New BPEL service]

image::switchyard/components/bpel/new_bpel_service_2.png[New BPEL service]

Whis will create the appropiate partnerLinks definitions.

image::switchyard/components/bpel/new_bpel_service_3.png[New BPEL service]

== Create a BPEL Component service
The created BPEL component contains a single 'implementation.bpel' element that identifies the fully qualified name of the BPEL process.

[source, java]
----
<sca:component name="Process">
   <sca:implementation.bpel process="process:Process"/>
   <sca:service name="Payment">
      <sca:interface.wsdl interface="META-INF/paymentService.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(Payment)"/>
   </sca:service>
</sca:component>
----

The component may also contain one or more service elements defining the WSDL port types through which the BPEL process can be accessed.

== Create a BPEL Component service
Define your process using WS-BPEL (e.g. using the Eclipse BPEL editor bundled with JBossTools).

image::switchyard/components/bpel/new_bpel_service_4.png[New BPEL service]

== Create a BPEL Component service
Define a Deployment Descriptor (/deploy.xml) using the ODE Deployment Descriptor editor bundled with JBossTools.

image::switchyard/components/bpel/new_bpel_service_5.png[New BPEL service]

== BPEL Component consuming a service

image::switchyard/components/bpel/invoke_service_from_bpel_1.png[Invoke BPEL service]

The first step is to define the WSDL interface(s), representing the service(s) to be consumed, using an invoke element within the deployment descriptor

[source,java]
----
<process name="ls:loanApprovalProcess">
        <active>true</active>
        <process-events generate="all"/>
        <provide partnerLink="customer">
            <service name="ls:loanService" port="loanService_Port"/>
        </provide>
        <invoke partnerLink="assessor" usePeer2Peer="false">
            <service name="ra:riskAssessor" port="riskAssessor_Port"/>
        </invoke>
    </process>
----

NOTE: The 'usePeer2Peer' property informs the BPEL engine not to use internal communications for sending messages between BPEL processes that may be executing within the same engine, and instead pass messages through the SwitchYard infrastructure.

For each consumed service, we then need to create a reference element within the SwitchYard configuration, to locate the WSDL file and identify the port type associated with the required WSDL service/port.

[source,java]
----
<sca:component name="loanService">
   <bpel:implementation.bpel process="ls:loanApprovalProcess" />
   <sca:service name="loanService">
      <sca:interface.wsdl interface="loanServicePT.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(loanServicePT)"/>
   </sca:service>
   <sca:reference name="riskAssessor" >
      <sca:interface.wsdl interface="riskAssessmentPT.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(riskAssessmentPT)"/>
   </sca:reference>
</sca:component>
----

== Structure of a BPEL application

image::switchyard/components/bpel/switchyard-BPEL-structure.png[BPEL application]

NOTE: The important part is how the artifacts are structured within the src/main/resources folder.

* The switchyard.xml configuration file is located in the META-INF folder as usual. However the BPEL deployment descriptor (deploy.xml), and the BPEL process definition are located in the root folder.
* The WSDL interface definitions, and any accompanying XSD schemas, can be located in sub-folders. If they are, then the BPEL process and SwitchYard BPEL component configuration must define the correct relative path.

== BPEL Component TIPS

* Avoid usage of BPEL components if possible

== Knowledge Services

* BPM component
* Rules component

Both BPM and Rules share the same execution engine, and share some common configurations

== BPM Component
To create a new BPM service in SwitchYard, you'll need the following information:

* File Name: the file name that will be used to create a new, empty BPMN 2 Process definition.
* Interface Type: the contract for the service being provided.  BPM supports Java, WSDL, and ESB contract types.
* Service Name: the name of the service your process will provide.

image::switchyard/components/bpm/new_bpm_service_1.png["New BPM component"]

image::switchyard/components/bpm/new_bpm_service_2.png["New BPM component"]

== Process interaction
Interaction with a process is defined via actions on a BPM service component.

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.userguide;
public interface MyService {
    public void start(String data);
    public void signal(String data);
    public void abort(String data);
}
----

Actions allow you to map an operation in the service contract to one of the following interactions with a business process:

----
START_PROCESS
SIGNAL_EVENT
SIGNAL_EVENT_ALL
ABORT_PROCESS_INSTANCE
----

image::switchyard/components/bpm/bpm_actions.jpg["BPM actions"]

== Starting a Process Instance
Operations configured with the *START_PROCESS* action type will start new process instances.

When you start your process (actually, any interaction with a service whose implementation is bpm), the processInstanceId will be put into the Switchyard Context at *Scope.MESSAGE*, and will be fed back to your client in a binding-specific way.  For soap, it will be in the form of a soap header in the soap response envelope:

[source,xml]
----
<soap:Header>
    <bpm:processInstanceId xmlns:bpm="urn:switchyard-component-bpm:bpm:1.0">1</bpm:processInstanceId>
</soap:Header>
----
In future process interactions, you will need to send back that same processInstanceId, so that the correlation is done properly.  For soap, that means including the same soap header that was returned in the response to be sent back with subsequent requests.

NOTE: If you are using persistence, the sessionId will also be available in the Context, and will need to be fed back as well.  It would look the same way in the soap header as the processInstanceId does.

== Correlation Keys
If you do not want to track the processInstanceId, however need to have multiple interactions with the same process instance, you can start the process with your own application-specific correlation key, and include that same correlation key for future interactions.  Here is an example of including in a a soap request:

[source,xml]
----
<soap:Header>
    <bpm:correlationKey xmlns:bpm="urn:switchyard-component-bpm:bpm:1.0">MY-APP-KEY-0123456789</bpm:correlationKey>
</soap:Header>
----

== Signaling a Process Instance
Operations configured with the *SIGNAL_EVENT* operation type will have the associated process instance signaled. 

NOTE: The processInstanceId will need to have been available in the Context so the correct process instance is correlated.

There are two other pieces of information when signaling an event:

* The *"event id"*.  In BPMN2 lexicon, this is known as the "signal id", but in jBPM can also be known as the "event type".  This is set as the eventId in the configuration.

NOTE: In BPMN2, a signal looks like this: <signal id="foo" value="bar"/>  In jBPM, it is the signal id that is respected, not the name.  This might require you to tweak a tooling-generated id to whatever you want it called.

* The *"event object"*.  This is the data representing the event itself, coming from the Message content object itself (your payload).

Operations configured with the *SIGNAL_EVENT_ALL* operation type will have all process instances signaled.

== Aborting a Process Instance
Operations configured with the *ABORT_PROCESS_INSTANCE* operation type will cause associated process instances to be aborted.

NOTE: The processInstanceId will need to have been available in the Context so the correct process instance is correlated.

== BPM Operations mappings
SwitchYard provides a flexible way to map data in and out service operation invocations via MVEL expressions.

image::switchyard/components/bpm/bpm_operations.png["Operations mappings"]

The above will create XML configuration like this:

[source,xml]
----
<operation name="process" type="START_PROCESS">
  <inputs>
    <input from="message.content.policy" to="Policy"/>
    <input from="message.content.driver" to="Driver"/>
  </inputs>
  <outputs>
    <output from="Policy" to="message.content"/>
  </outputs>
  <faults>
    <fault from="ProcessingFault" to="message.content"/>
  </faults>
</operation>
----

NOTE: All of the different mapping types support a from and to attribute. Those attributes get configured with MVEL expressions, which themselves support variables that can come from process or global variable names, implicit variable names, or variables that get resolved from properties.

== Globals
If your process executes business rules, you can use global mappings to access data in your rules which do not trigger rule execution themselves, but can be used in either the LHS or RHS of your rules for customization. 

== Inputs
For the BPM component, inputs are used to set process instance variables that can later be referenced by nodes within your process.

NOTE: For you to be able to use variables inside your process, you have to declare your variable names at the process level, as well as in the Parameter Mapping (and possibly Result Mapping) of any process node that wants access to those variables. This can be done easily in the BPMN2 Eclipse tooling by using the Properties view when clicking on either the whitespace around the process, or on any of your process nodes.

== Outputs
Outputs are used to extract process instance variables so that they can be set in the outgoing SwitchYard Message content.

== Faults
Fault mapping is similar to Output mapping, however the data represents an Exception or data that will be wrapped in an Exception.

== Implicit variables

* *context*: The current org.switchyard.Context.
* *message*: The current org.switchyard.Message.

Examples:
----
from="message.content" - This is the same as message.getContent().
from="context[‘foo’]" - This is the same as context.getProperty("foo", Scope.MESSAGE).getValue(), in a null-safe manner.
----

== Calling a BPM process
We are going to do a walk through of creating a BPM process and calling it from SwitchYard. Our process will call 3 other SwitchYard service as part of it orchestration logic.

image::switchyard/components/bpm/bpm_process_definition.png["Process Definition"]

Our process consist of one method, that receives an *Order* and answers with an *OrderAck*.

[source,java]
----
import org.switchyard.quickstarts.bpm.service.data.Order;
import org.switchyard.quickstarts.bpm.service.data.OrderAck;

public interface ProcessOrder {
    OrderAck submitOrder(Order order);
}
----

To invoke the BPM process, we select the properties for the BPM component in the Switchyard editor, and map the operations to BPM process events. For this particular example, we will map the *submitOrder* operation to trigger the start of the process with *START_PROCESS*, and we map the operation input and output data types to the process data types.

image::switchyard/components/bpm/process_properties_2.png["Process operation mapping"]

As can be seen, the operation input value is mapped with *message.content* to a process variable called *input_param*. For the operation return type, we get the process result, which will come in a process variable that we have called *output_result*. (By default, BPM will use an output variable called *Result*).

Our process definition is quite simple, it will invoke a SwitchYard service, and will evaluate the result of this invocation to decide which other service to call amongst two. The result of the invocation of this last service call will be used as a result of the whole process, this means, as a result of the operation being invoked.

image:switchyard/components/bpm/process.png["Process definition"]

To be able to interact with SwitchYard, we map the input and output parameters to "Process variables", as well as we declare some other variables to be used along the process execution.

image:switchyard/components/bpm/variables.png["Process Variables definition"]

When you want to invoke from a BPM process a *SwitchYard Service*, that means a SwitchYard "Reference", you just drop the *SwitchYardServiceTask* to the canvas and set the required properties. By default there will be the required properties for the invocation:

image:switchyard/components/bpm/switchyard_task_defaults.png["SwitchYard Service Task defaults"]

We then need to fill:

* *ServiceName*
* *OperationName*

And then map the SwitchYard Task invocation parameters, to the process variables. (Shown in red in the picture below)

image:switchyard/components/bpm/switchyard_task_params.png["SwitchYard Service Task params"]

In this example, we have copied the result of the call to the Inventory service into a process variable called *InventoryAvailable* that we use in the following gateway to select where to divert.

image:switchyard/components/bpm/divert.png["Exclusive gateway"]

Once the gateway selects the route to take, it is time to call last "SwitchYard Service", and again, setting up required fields and mappings to process variables. This time, the result of the execution of the SwitchYard Service will be mapped to the BPM process output.

image:switchyard/components/bpm/process_output.png["Process output mapping"]

NOTE: The name of the process defines the scope for the process variables. (ProcessOrder in this example)

== Rules Component
To create a new Rules service in SwitchYard, you'll need the following information

* *File Name*: the file name that will be used to create a new template rules definition.
* *Interface Type*: the contract for the service being provided.  Rules services support Java, WSDL, and ESB contract types.
* *Service Name*: the name of the service your process will provide.
* *Package Name*: package name used for the new Rules file.

image::switchyard/components/rules/new_rules.jpg[New Rules component]

== Rules Component

The ExampleService interface can be as simple as this (with no SwitchYard-specific imports):

[source,java]
----
package com.example.switchyard.docs;
public interface Example {
    public void process(MyData data);
}
----

The generated rule template will look like this:
[source,java]
----
package com.example.switchyard.docs
import org.switchyard.Message
global Message message
 
rule "RulesExample"
   when
      // insert conditional here
   then
      // insert consequence here
      System.out.println("service: ExampleService, payload: " + message.getContent());
end
----

== Rules Operations mappings
SwitchYard provides a flexible way to map data in and out service operation invocations via MVEL expressions.

image::switchyard/components/rules/rules_operations.png["Operations mappings"]

The above will create XML configuration like this:

[source,xml]
----
<operation name="process" type="EXECUTE">
  <globals>
    <global from="context['org.switchyard.messageId']" to="messageId"/>
  </globals>
  <inputs>
    <input from="message.content.policy"/>
    <input from="message.content.driver"/>
    <input from="context['org.example.foobar']"/>
  </inputs>
  <outputs>
    <output from="globals.Result" to="message.content"/>
  </outputs>
  <faults>
    <fault from="globals.Fault" to="message.content"/>
  </faults>
</operation>
----

== Generated rules service

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.example.docs
 
global java.lang.String messageId
global java.util.Map globals
 
rule "Approval"
    when
        policy : Policy(threshold >= 600)
    then
        policy.setFlag(true);
        globals.put("Result", policy);
end
 
rule "Denial"
    when
        policy : Policy(threshold < 600)
    then
        policy.setFlag(false);
        globals.put("Result", policy);
end
----

== Globals
If your process executes business rules, you can use global mappings to access data in your rules which do not trigger rule execution themselves, but can be used in either the LHS or RHS of your rules for customization. 

They also provide a nice way to define in/out "buckets" so you can get data out of rule execution.

[source,java]
----
   globals.put("resultingPolicy", policy);
----

IMPORTANT: The global variable called globals (java.util.Map) is always available for in/out purposes.  You don't have to configure it in your <globals> section for it to be available to your BPM/DRL.

== Globals - TIP
If you want to use your own application object as in in/out variable, you are free to do so.

You can even dynamically create your own Map using *MVEL* and name it what you want.

[source,xml]
----
<operation name="process" type="EXECUTE">
  <globals>
    <!-- the from is an MVEL construct which creates a new Map -->
    <global from="['':'']" to="holder"/>
  </globals>
  <outputs>
    <!-- this assumes you did a holder.put("out", someObject) at some point -->
    <output from="holder.out" to="message.content"/>
  </outputs>
</operation>
----

== Inputs
Inputs are the "facts" that are inserted into the Drools rules engine.

NOTE: If you do not specify your own Inputs, the default will be the incoming Message content. 

IMPORTANT: If you do specify your own Inputs, the incoming Message content will not be inserted as a fact, and you will have to include "message.content" yourself, if desired.

== Outputs
Using in/out variables (for example, the global Map called "globals"), we can extract data out of the rules execution and into the outgoing Message content.

IMPORTANT: If you do not specify your own Outputs, the default will be the result of the expression "globals.Result".

WARNING: If you do not specify your own Outputs, or in your DRL, you do not populate the "Result" of the globals Map, then your Rules component execution will return null. For IN_OUT Exchange patterns this is a problem.

== Faults
Fault mapping is similar to Output mapping, however the data represents an Exception or data that will be wrapped in an Exception.

== Stateless vs. Stateful Rules Execution

*Rules services are stateless by default*. Service method invocation will create a new Drools knowledge session, execute it given the passed-in domain data, and then be cleanly disposed.

*To use a stateful session*, use the FIRE_ALL_RULES action type instead of EXECUTE.

*To insert facts into a stateful knowledge session without firing the rules*, use the INSERT operation type.

== Channels
* Drools supports the notion of "Channels", which are basically "exit points" in your DRL.
* They can be used in both stateful and stateless sessions.

[source,java]
----
package com.example
rule "example rule"
    when
        $f : Foo ( bar > 10 )
    then
        channels["Bar"].send( $f.getBar() );
end
----

[source,xml]
----
<channels>
    <channel class="com.example.BarChannel" name="Bar"/>
</channels>
----

WARNING: Channels must implement org.kie.api.runtime.Channel.

== Consume another SwitchYard Service from a rules service
SwitchYard provides an out-of-the-box Channel which allows you to invoke (one-way) other SwitchYard services directly and easily from your DRL.

[source,xml]
----
<channel name="HelloWorld" reference="HelloWorld" operation="greet"/>
----

Parameters to the SwitchYard channel
* *class*: The channel implementation class. (Default is SwitchYardServiceChannel.)
* *name*: The channel name. (default = simple name of the implementation class)
* *reference*: The service reference qualified name.
* *operation* The service reference operation name.

== Complex Event Processing - Configure
How to configure via XML? (it can be done via JBDS tooling)

[source,xml]
----
<implementation.rules ...>
    <operations>
        <operation eventId="FooStream" name="processFooMessage" type="FIRE_UNTIL_HALT"/>
        <operation eventId="BarStream" name="processBarMessage" type="FIRE_UNTIL_HALT"/>
    </operations>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="drools.clockType" value="realtime"/>
        <property name="drools.eventProcessingMode" value="stream"/>
        <property name="drools.maxThreads" value="1"/>
        <property name="drools.multithreadEvaluation" value="false"/>
    </properties>
</implementation.rules>
----

NOTE: The type of "FIRE_UNTIL_HALT" is required for CEP scenarios.

== Complex Event Processing - Insert facts
*How do facts (data) get inputted for CEP?*

Operations of type FIRE_UNTIL_HALT can specify <inputs> just like any other operation. If all of your inputs have "from" attributes but not "to" attributes, then:

* If the "eventId" attribute on the operation element is set, then the eventId is your entry point that the data gets inserted into. (Unicast)
* If the "eventId" attribute on the operation element is not set, then everything gets inserted into the stateful session, not into an entry point. ((Multicast)

== KnowledgeServices Listeners
Listeners are used to monitor specific types of events that occur during Knowledge execution.

[source,xml]
----
<listeners>
    <listener class="org.drools.core.event.DebugProcessEventListener"/>
    <listener class="org.kie.api.event.rule.DebugWorkingMemoryEventListener"/>
    <listener class="com.example.MyListener"/>
</listeners>
----

== KnowledgeServices Loggers
Loggers are special types of Listeners, and are used to output the events that occur during Knowledge execution. Events can be logged to the CONSOLE or to a FILE.

[source,xml]
----
<loggers>
    <logger interval="2000" log="myLog" type="THREADED_FILE"/>
    <logger type="CONSOLE/>
</loggers>
----

== KnowledgeServices MANIFEST
MANIFEST is where you specify where the "intelligence" of the component comes from. 

* For the *BPM* component, this will be, at the minimum, the location of the BPMN 2 process definition file.
* For the *Rules* component, this will most likely be the location of DRL, DSL, DSLR or XLS files. 

There are two ways to to configure the Manifest:

* With a KIE Container. This relies upon the existence of a META-INF/kmodule.xml configuration file.
* With a manually defined list of Resources.

WARNING: These two options are mutually exclusive.

.META-INF/kmodule.xml

== Core concepts

SwitchYard uses Camel internally to communicate between its parts (bindings and components) and follows Camel concepts in terms of Messages, Exchange, ...

image::switchyard/core_switchyard.png[SwitchYard Core concepts]

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.Message

A Message represents an individual input or output of a service, the content of which is interpreted by service implementation logic.

A Message does not carry context specific to a service invocation, which means that it can be copied and reused across service invocations. There are two distinct parts to a message:

* *Content*: the main body, or payload, of the message. There is only one body per message instance. The message body is mutable, so message processing logic can access the content, change it (transform, enrich, etc.), and then set it back on the message.
* *Attachments*: provide the ability to associate content with a message separate from  the main body, allowing it to be parsed independently. One example  would be a binary image that is referenced by the main body of the message.  The attachment may be too large to be processed in certain services or the service implementation may not be able to  parse/interpret it.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.Exchange

An Exchange provides a conduit for the messages that flow into and out of a service  as part of a service invocation.

An Exchange represents an instance of a service invocation with a specific message exchange pattern (e.g. InOnly, InOut).  

Unlike messages, an exchange cannot be copied and reused across service invocations. State associated with an invocation (i.e. context) is maintained at the exchange level.

* *org.switchyard.ExchangePhase*: Represents the phase of an exchange. (INPUT or OUTPUT)

* *org.switchyard.ExchangeState*: Represents the state of an Exchange (OK, FAULT)

* *org.switchyard.ExchangePattern*: The list of supported exchange patterns within SwitchYard. (IN_ONLY, IN_OUT)

* *org.switchyard.metadata.ExchangeContract*: Two-way Exchange contract, detailing the requirements of both the consumer and provider ServiceOperation being invoked.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.Context

Holds contextual information around the exchange of messages between a service consumer and provider.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.Service

A service registered with the SwitchYard runtime.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.ServiceReference

A service registered with the SwitchYard runtime.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.ServiceDomain

A ServiceDomain represents a collection of services with a shared set of resources, configuration, and policy definitions.  The ServiceDomain interface is used by software components to provide and/or consume services.  These software components include protocol gateways, service containers, translation engines, adapters, orchestration and routing engines.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.metadata.ServiceOperation
epresentation of an operation on a ServiceInterface. Each operation has:

* an exchange pattern (IN_OUT, IN_ONLY)
* a name
* an input message referenced type
* an (optional) output message type
* an (optional) fault message type

The mapping of operation and message names is defined by the concrete implementation of ServiceInterface.  For example, the expected mapping of a Java interface would be Java method name to ServiceInterface operation name.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.metadata.ServiceInterface
The canonical representation of a service interface in SwitchYard.  

Every service in SwitchYard is registered with exactly one ServiceInterface, providing information on the type, operations, and input/output messages for the service. 

The SwitchYard runtime provides concrete implementations of ServiceInterface for Java and WSDL interface types. 

There is also a default type of *ServiceInterface.DEFAULT_TYPE* which is used to represent services which do not publish a formal contract.

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.ServiceMetadata
Contains runtime details on services and service references registered in SwitchYard.

Instances of ServiceMetadata can be created and updated using the ServiceMetadataBuilder class

== Core concepts - org.switchyard.ExchangeHandler
The role of a Handler is to handle messages and fault events during the course of a service invocation.

When consuming a service, a handler can be registered during Exchange creation to handle consumer events (e.g. fault or reply message).

When providing a service, a handler is specified while registering the service to process invocations of that service.

== Core concepts- How an Exchange works

TODO: Describe how an Exchange goes from one ServiceHandler/Exchange to another ServiceHandler/ExchangeHandler, how the message is created. How to create and set new messages back in the Exchange, What is the pipeline that drives the Exchange lifecycle,...

== Core concepts - ServiceHandlers

Every SwitchYard application has a composite service with one or multiple bindings. 

Every binding acts as an endpoint. Incoming endpoint if it is a binding on a service or outgoing endpoint if it is a binding on a reference. 

This endpoints are created, registered and started when the aplication gets deployed, and are stoped, unregistered and destroyed when the application is undeployed.

Every endpoint implements *org.switchyard.deploy.ServiceHandler*

There are inbound handlers and outbound handlers, depending if they act as server endpoints or client endpoints.

Inbound handlers:

* org.switchyard.component.camel.common.handler.InboundHandler: An handler that acts as a gateway/entrypoint for Camel Components.
* org.switchyard.component.http.InboundHandler: Hanldes HTTP requests to invoke a SwitchYard service.
* org.switchyard.component.resteasy.InboundHandler: Handles RESTEasy requests to invoke a SwitchYard service.
* org.switchyard.component.soap.InboundHandler: Handles SOAP requests to invoke a SwitchYard service.
* org.switchyard.component.sca.SCAEndpoint: For publishing services as SCA

Outbound handlers:

* org.switchyard.component.camel.common.handler.OutboundHandler: A handler that is capable of calling Apache Camel components.
* org.switchyard.component.http.OutboundHandler: Handles invoking external HTTP services.
* org.switchyard.component.resteasy.OutboundHandler: Handles invoking external RESTEasy services.
* org.switchyard.component.soap.OutboundHandler: Handles invoking external Webservice endpoints.
* org.switchyard.component.sca.SCAInvoker: Handles outbound communication to an SCA service endpoint

image::switchyard/service_handlers.jpg[Service Handlers]

== How does an InboundHandler Works

When it is created, an instance of the BindingModel (configuration) is passed, as well as an instance of the ServiceDomain, is passed to the InboundHandler.

When it starts creates the ServiceReference representing the endpoint, the endpoint for the corresponding binding and the message composer.

Provides one method, *invoke*, where all the logic for an invocation to the endpoint happens.

When it stops, the endpoint is stopped.

== InboundHandler.invoke()

* creates an Exchange
* add identy to the Exchange to identify the origin of the invocation
* compose the message (*MessageComposer.compose()*) from the passed binding Message (*BindingData*)
* send the Message to the Exchange (*Exchange.send()*)
* If it is IN_OUT:
** it will wait for a response (Default timeout of 5 minutes)
** it will decompose the response (*MessageComposer.decompose()*)
* it returns the decomposed message as *BindingData*

== How does a message translation works
Here we will find a description of what is happening at the message composition time in a call to a SwitchYard application through an external binding and having one call to an external reference through a binding.

image::switchyard/core/MessageComposition_Flow.jpg[Message composition flow]

. *Request message from binding to service (Request from client)*. The request message is converted from the binding message type to the internal SwitchYard *Message*, and all the binding headers (HTTP, SOAP, ...) will be mapped into the corresponding properties in the SwitchYard *Context* associated to the Message, and it is set to the Exchange.
. *Service component implementations execution*. The request pipelines of a component will be executed, until a there is a call to an external service.
. *Request message from reference to binding (External service call)*. A call to the external service is about to happen, and message needs to be converted from SwitchYard Message to the reference binding data, the MessageComposer will decompose the message back to the binding format and properties will be extracted from the SwitchYard *Context* and set into the binding message. 
. *Response message from binding to reference (Response from remote service)*. Once the external service has been executed, the response from this external service will be mapped back into SwitchYard by the MessageComposer.mapFrom(). The ContextMapper will copy the appropiate message/transport headers back into the Message *Context* 
. *Service execution*. The rest of the components` pipeline will be executed.
. *Response message from service to binding (Response to client caller)*. When our application has ended it's execution and it is returning the result to the caller, the MessageComposer will decompose the SwitchYard message back to the binding message and the ContextMapper will map the properties in the Context back to the binding message.

NOTE: Additional behaviour relative to the correspoding transaltions will exist in the predefined MessageComposers and ContextMappers (SOAP, REST, HTTP,...) 

== How does an OutboundHandler Works
When it is created, an instance of the BindingModel (configuration) is passed, as well as an instance of the ServiceDomain, is passed to the OutboundHandler.

When it starts creates and configures a ENdpoint consumer to access the external service through the corresponding Binding method (HTTP, SOAP, REST, ...).

Provides one method, *handleMessage*, where all the logic for an invocation to the external service happens.

No stop lifecycle.

== OutboundHandler.handleMessage()
* add identy to the Exchange to identify the origin of the invocation
* decompose the message (*MessageComposer.decompose()*) to a binding Message (*BindingData*)
* it will use the dispatcher (HTTP, SOAP, REST, ...) to invoke the real service with the binding data
* If it is IN_OUT:
** it will wait for a response
** it will compose the response (*MessageComposer.compose()*) from the received BindingData back into a Message
* send the Message to the Exchange (*Exchange.send()*) (or *Exchange.sendFault()* if it was an error)


== Core concepts - ExchangeHandler Chains
Communications between components and bindings to/from components is done by a LocalExchangeBus.

NOTE: This is the wire

There is a chain of ExchangeHandlers acting as interceptors for the request and response pipelines of the wire. The default chain has the following:

* *RequestChain*
** *addressing*: AddressingHandler resolves service instances based on a service reference.
** *transaction-pre-invoke*: TransactionHandler interprets transactional policy specified on an exchange and handles transactional requirements. Suspends current transaction and creates a new one, creates a new one, join an ongoing transaction,...
** *security-process*:  SecurityHandler interprets security policy specified on an exchange and handles security requirements. Cretes the SecurityContext and SecurityProvider and attaches to the thread.
** *generic-policy*: PolicyHandler
** *validation-before-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the Exchange`s content type.
** *transformation*: TransformHandler applies all the defined transformations (*org.switchyard.transform.TRansformer*) for the message for consumer.inputType to provider.inputType and set the Exchange's new content type.
** *validation-after-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the new Exchange`s content type.
** *provider*: ProviderHandler dispatches the message to the provider (component).
** *security-cleanup*: SecurityHandler cleanup of context and thread info.
** *transaction-post-invoke*: TransactionHandler commits or rollback, or resume suspended transaction,...

image::switchyard/core/HandlerChain_IN_ONLY.png[IN_ONLY Handler Chain]

NOTE: Only IN_OUT Exchanges will execute the ReplyChain, that's why there are 2 Handlers after the execution of the provider, to cleanup/finish tasks.
        
* *ReplyChain*
** *validation-before-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the Exchange`s content type.
** *transformation*: TransformHandler applies all the defined transformations (*org.switchyard.transform.TRansformer*) for the message for provider.outputType to consumer.outputType and set the Exchange's new content type.
** *validation-after-transform*: ValidateHandler executes the *org.switchyard.validate.Validator* defined for the new Exchange`s content type.
** *HandlerChain.CONSUMER_HANDLER*: BaseHandler

* *wsdlPort*: port name in the WSDL to use.  If unspecified, the first port definition in the WSDL is used for the service endpoint
* *socketAddr*: the IP Socket Address to be used. The value can be in the form hostName/ipAddress:portNumber or hostName/ipAddress or :portNumber.
* *contextPath*: additional context path for the SOAP endpoint. (Default is none)

* *unwrapped Payload*: Checking this option it will unwrap the message's payload (explained later).
* *SOAP Headers Type*: How it will extract the SOAP headers into SwitchYard (explained later)
* *Endpoint Configuration*: cxf.xml configuration file for external endpoint configuration (Does not work)

==  Composers
A MessageComposer can compose or decompose a native binding message to/from SwitchYard's canonical message.  A MessageComposer does this in three steps:

1. Construct a new target message instance.
2. Copy the content ("body") of the message.
3. Delegate the header/property mapping to a ContextMapper.

 We currently provide a SOAPMessageComposer, a HttpMessageComposer, and a RESTEasyMessageComposer, CamelMessageComposer.  These default implementations are used by their associated bindings, but can be overridden by the user.

[source,java]
----
public interface MessageComposer<D extends BindingData> {
    public ContextMapper<D> getContextMapper();
    public MessageComposer<D> setContextMapper(ContextMapper<D> contextMapper);

    public Message compose(D source, Exchange exchange) throws Exception;
    public D decompose(Exchange exchange, D target) throws Exception;
}
----

== SOAPMessageComposer - compose

NOTE: compose happens in requests to Services and responses from References 

. creates a SwitchYardMessage
. call the SOAPContextMapper.mapFrom to copy all the headers into the context
. if it is a SOAPFault, creates a Message with the contents being the SOAPFaultDetail and returns it (This is for responses from References)
. otherwise creates a Message with the SOAPEnvelope contents (unwrapped if configured) and adds all the SOAP attachments to the SwitchYard Message attachments

WARNING: This is a rough simplification, as there are many validations and more logic inside

== SOAPMessageComposer - decompose

NOTE: decompose happens in responses from Services and requests to References 

. if the message is already a SOAP Message, just return it
. otherwise creates a SOAP message from the contents of the SwitchYard message (wrap the message if configured and needed), and return a SOAPFault if message is a fault
. add the existing attachments in the SwitchYard Message
. if message is an Exception, throw the Exception and let JAX-WS format the fault
. call the SOAPContextMapper.mapFrom to copy all the headers into the context
. returns the binding data (SOAP Message)

A ContextMapper moves native binding message headers and/or properties to/from SwitchYard's canonical context.  

 Many ContextMapper implementations are provided OOTB. These default implementations are used by their associated bindings, but can be overridden by the user.

== SOAPContextMapper - mapFrom

NOTE: mapFrom happens in requests to Services and responses from References 

. if message has a fault, set it as a property in the context with key "soap_fault_info" and label "SOAP_HEADER_LABELS"
. if there is HTTP status code, set it as property with key "http_response_status" and label "SOAP_MIME_LABELS"
. get all the mime headers and set them as properties with the header name as key and label "SOAP_MIME_LABELS"
. get all the soap headers and set them as properties with the header *QName* as key and label "SOAP_HEADERS_LABELS", transformed according to the binding configuration (config, value, dom, xml)

WARNING: This is a rough simplification, as there are many validations and more logic inside

== SOAPContextMapper - mapTo

NOTE: mapTo happens in requests to Services and responses from References 

. iterate over all the context properties
. if it qualiefies as a SOAP header (that means the property name is a *QName*) and matches the filtered headers configured in the binding (for the whole QNAME) add convert to SOAP header and add to returned message
. otherwise, if it matches the configured header filter or it is a property with an label of *EnpointLabel.HTTP* it will be added as mime_header with the property as header name, and the property value as header value
. (special case) if the property name is *SOAPContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* the the value (integer) will be set as status for the SOAP message.

== Message Composition Explained with an example

Here we will find a description of what is happening at the message composition time in a call to a SwitchYard application through an HTTP binding and having one call to an external reference through an HTTP binding.

image::switchyard/core/MessageComposition_Flow.jpg[Message composition flow]

== (1) Request message from binding to service
The request message is converted from the binding message type to the internal service type. For this to happen, a call to *HttpMessageComposer.compose()*.

In this method two things will happen:

* It will create a *Message* for the *Exchange*.

* A call to *HttpContextMapper.mapFrom(HttpRequestBindingData, context)* will be done. This method will:

** It will copy *requestInfo* from the *HTTPRequestBindingData* into the message *Context* with key *HttpComposition.HTTP_REQUEST_INFO* and assigning the following labels, *ComponentLabel.HTTP* and *EndpointLabel.HTTP*

NOTE: HttpRequestInfo has all the required information from the request, and is the source of information that can be used in the SwitchYard's component implementations to access information relative to the request, such as requestURI, requestPath, method, contextPath,... link:https://github.com/jboss-switchyard/components/blob/master/http/src/main/java/org/switchyard/component/http/composer/HttpRequestInfo.java#L35-L56[See the implementation of this class to find all the available information].

** It will copy all headers from the HTTP request that match the defined includes and exludes regex pattern for the composer at design time.

NOTE: Headers are not automatically copied, you have to add to messageComposer which headers you want to include (.*: all)

image::switchyard/core/MessageComposer_Configuration.png[Message Composer Configuration]

WARNING: When checking for headers, or defining headers in Binding's RegEx Inclusion and Exclusion, all headers are *lowercased*. If you send a header *Authorization*, you should check for *authorization* instead.

* It will copy the content from the *HttpBindingData* to the *Message* that will flow through SwitchYard converting it to the appropiate type.

* It will return the *Message*.

== (2) Service component implementations execution
The request pipelines of a component will be executed, until a there is a call to an external HTTP service.

== (3) Request message from reference to binding
A call to the external service is about to happen, and message needs to be converted from SwitchYard message to the reference binding data.

* A call to *HttpMessageComposer.decompose(Exchange, HttpRequestBindingData)* will be done. This method will:
** Copies the content from the *Exchange* to the content *HttpRequestBindingData*
** Calls *HttpContextMapper.mapTo(Request)* to copy headers from the Message`s *Context* to the HttpRequestBindingData's http headers. These properties will be copied only if they match the registered regexp expressions in the MessageComposer's design time configuration or if the properties are marked with the EndpointLabel.HTTP label in the Context.


== (4) Response message from binding to reference
Once the external service has being executed, we have to deal with the response from this external service, and map it back into SwitchYard. To to this, a call to *HttpMessageComposer.compose(HttpResponseBindingData, Exchange) will be done. This method will:

* Create a Message

* Call *HttpContextMapper.mapFrom(HttpResponseBindingData, Message)* that will:
** Copies the statusCode of the invocation into a Context property called *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* with labels http (ComponentLabel.HTTP and EnpointLabel.HTTP)
** It will copy all headers from the HTTP response that match the defined includes and exludes regex pattern for the composer at design time.

NOTE: Headers are not automatically copied, you have to add to messageComposer which headers you want to include (.*: all)

* It will copy the content from the *HttpBindingData* to the *Message* that will flow through SwitchYard converting it to the appropiate type.

* It will return the *Message*.

== (5) Service execution
The rest of the components` pipeline will be executed.

== (6) Response message from service to binding
When our application has ended it's execution and it is returning the result to the caller, it will call again *HttpMessageComposer.decompose(Exchange, HttpResponseBindingData)* to convert the SwitchYard message to the binding message or content.
It will:
* Get statusCode from Context property *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* that has been established as part of the SwitchYard service execution.

NOTE: This property could be the one that was set from the invocation to the external Composite's Reference. (In step 4)

- If there is no statusCode set as a property, or this statusCode property does not have the *EndpointLabel.HTTP*  label, it will calculate one depending on the content and on the *Exchange.getState*. If the state of the Exchange is *ExchangeState.FAULT* it will return an HTTP Error code of *500*. (link:https://github.com/jboss-switchyard/components/blob/master/http/src/main/java/org/switchyard/component/http/composer/HttpMessageComposer.java#L73-L88[See the code for the logic determining the statusCode])
* Copy the content from the SwitchYard's *Message* to the *HttpResponseBindingData*
* Call HttpContextMapper.mapTo(HttpResponseBindingData) that will:
** Copy headers from the Message`s *Context* to the HttpRequestBindingData's http headers. These properties will be copied only if they match the registered regexp expressions in the MessageComposer's design time configuration or if the properties are marked with the EndpointLabel.HTTP label in the Context.
** If the property is *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* it will set the status on the HttpResponseBindingData


== HOWTO pass a header from an incoming request to use it in the SwitchYard application
You need to add the header in the Message Composer design time configuration screen for the Composite Service Http Binding.

image::switchyard/core/pass_header.png[Authorization header]

NOTE: Remember that headers are *lowercased*.

If you want to progress this header to a Composite Reference, you need to add it again to the Composite Reference Http Binding's Message Composer design time configuration screen

== HOWTO send a header to an outgoing request
You need to add the header in the context of the invocation with EndpointLabel.HTTP. To be able to modify aspects of the call to the reference, this need to be done as a ReferenceInvoker rather than as a regular Reference.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Reference("RealHttpService")
private ReferenceInvoker referenceInvoker;

public String myBeanMethod(String params){
   String replyContent = "";
   ReferenceInvocation invocation = null;

   try{
      invocation = referenceInvoker.newInvocation();
      Context context = invocation.getMessage().getContext();

      // Set the header we want
      context.setProperty("Authorization", "xxxx").addLabels(EndpointLabel.HTTP.label());

      // Call the service
      replyContent = invocation.invoke(params).getMessage().getContent(String.class);
   }catch(Exception e){
      // Manage exception
   }
   return replyContent;
}
----

== HOWTO change configuration for calling service (method, queryString, queryArgs). How to invoke dynamically

WARNING: This is not possible with HTTP Binding reference. You have to use Camel binding reference.

image::switchyard/core/camel_reference_binding.png[Camel Reference binding]

To be able to modify aspects of the call to the reference, this need to be done as a ReferenceInvoker rather than as a regular Reference.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Reference("RealHttpService")
private ReferenceInvoker referenceInvoker;

public String myBeanMethod(String params){
   String replyContent = "";
   ReferenceInvocation invocation = null;

   // We get information from incoming request
   HttpRequestInfo requestInfo = msgContext.getPropertyValue(HttpComposition.HTTP_REQUEST_INFO);

   try{
      invocation = referenceInvoker.newInvocation();
      Context context = invocation.getMessage().getContext();

      // We copy (progress)  method, path and query string
      context.setProperty(org.apache.camel.Exchange.HTTP_METHOD, 
                              requestInfo.getMethod());
      context.setProperty(org.apache.camel.Exchange.HTTP_URI, 
                              "http://localhost:8080" +  requestInfo.getPathInfo());
      context.setProperty(org.apache.camel.Exchange.HTTP_QUERY, 
                              requestInfo.getQueryString());

      // Call the service
      replyContent = invocation.invoke(params).getMessage().getContent(String.class);
   }catch(Exception e){
      // Manage exception
   }
   return replyContent;
}
----

== HOWTO check the status code of an invocation to an external service
You need to check for the following context Property *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS*

----
@Inject
@Reference("RealHttpService")
private ReferenceInvoker referenceInvoker;

public String myBeanMethod(String params){
   String replyContent = "";
   ReferenceInvocation invocation = null;

   try{
      invocation = referenceInvoker.newInvocation();
      ....
      // Call the service
      replyContent = invocation.invoke(params).getMessage().getContent(String.class);
   }catch(Exception e){
      int statusCode = invocation
                         .getContext()
                         .getPropertyValue(HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS);
      // Manage exception
      ...
   }
   return replyContent;
}
----

== HOWTO set the status code of an invocation to a SwitchYard application
You need to set the following context Property *HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS* with label *EndpointLabel.HTTP*. In order to do this in a component, you need to create a new Message and send it to the Exchange.

In a BeanComponent:

[source,java]
----
private void replyWithHTTPStatusCode(Exchange currentExchange, int statusCode) {
   Message reply = currentExchange.createMessage();
   reply.getContext().setProperty(HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS, 
                                  statusCode)
                     .addLabels(EndpointLabel.HTTP.label());
   currentExchange.send(reply);
}
----

In a CamelComponent:

In a Route:

[source,java]
----
.to("EXTERNAL_SERVICE")
.setHeader(HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS, constant(200))
----

In a Processor:

[source,java]
----
exchange.getIn().setHeader(HttpContextMapper.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS, statusCode);
----

== HOWTO copy all HTTP incoming headers and progress them
Right now there is no way to copy all headers from Http service binding to an Http Reference Binding but to specify all the headers you want to copy in the regex includes field for both MessageComposers.
Another option is to create your own MessageComposer, that extends the basic HttpMessageComposer and copy all the headers in the context in the Service Binding, and then set them back in the Reference Binding.

== Context Properties

*org.switchyard.Property*: Represents a context property consisting of a name, scope, and value and a set of labels.


== Scopes
Two scopes exist when defining and setting properties into the *org.switchyard.Context*:

* *Scope.EXCHANGE*: Properties available for the duration of an exchange.
* *Scope.MESSAGE*: Properties available as part of a message.

NOTE: *Headers are scoped as MESSAGE*. You will see some headers specifically useful for http requests, and other headers specifically useful for http responses. 
In both cases, they are most likely tied to the binding's notion of an incoming message or an outgoing message.

NOTE:  *Properties are scoped as EXCHANGE*, as this is most likely application or domain data, and possibly useful in the entire processing of the Exchange.

== Labels
Labels are a way to mark a Context Property, and relate it to a SwitchYard funcionality.

Base class is *org.switchyard.label.Label*

There are 5 types of labels (OOTB):

* *BehaviorLabel*: Marks the property relative to certain actions and/or behavior. (Copy of context,...) (label type: *behavior*)
** _TRANSIENT_: the property will not be preserved in a copy of the Exchange via Context.copy()
* *ComponentLabel*: Marks the property relative to certain component (label type: *component*)
** CAMEL, HORNETQ, HTTP, JCA, RESTEASY, SOAP
* *EnpointLabel*: Marks the property relative to Endpoint related actions (context composition, message composers,...) (label type: *endpoint*)
** AMQP, ATOM, DIRECT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, HTTP, JCA, JMS, JPA, MAIL, MOCK, QUARTZ, REST, SEDA, SFTP, SOAP, SQL, TCP, TIMER, UDP, URI
* *HttpInvokerLabel*: Marks the property to be used as a header in the HTTPInvoker (label type: *httpinvoker*) 
** HEADER
* *PropertyLabel*: Marks the type of the property (label type: *property*)
** HEADER, PROPERTY

== Labels (for humans)
A label is composed following this rule:

----
prefix.<lowercase(label_type)>.<lowercase(label_name)> 
----

* prefix: "org.switchyard.label."
* label type: (behavior, component, endpoint, httpinvoker, property)
* label name: (TRANSIENT, CAMEL, HTTP, JCA,....., HEADER, PROPERTY)

Examples:
----
org.switchyard.label.Label.behavior.transient
org.switchyard.label.Label.endpoint.http
org.switchyard.label.Label.endpoint.soap
org.switchyard.label.Label.component.soap
org.switchyard.label.Label.property.header

== SwitchYard - Transformations (Java, JAXB, JSON, Smooks, XSLT, ...)

When is a transformation required:

 When origin type and destination type of a "wire connection" is not of the same type, and implicit type conversion (provided by Camel type converters) can not convert between both types.

 Declarative transformation only kicks in when the runtime detects that the message type is different between the consumer and provider contracts.

The tooling reflects this as well, which is why if there are no interactions where contract types differ, then you cannot create a transformer. There are three scenarios in SY where the contract types can differ and require a transformation:
 
1. A composite service interface is different from the component service interface it promotes.
2. A component reference interface is different from the component service interface it is wired to.
3. A composite reference interface is different from the component reference interface it promotes.

* Different implementations for transformations:
** Java
** JAXB
** JSON
** Smooks
** XSLT
** Transformations in a Camel component
** Other (coming next: Dozer,...)

TODO: http://www.mastertheboss.com/jboss-soa/switchyard-tutorial/page-2

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Content Type Names

Since transformations occur between named types (i.e. from type A, to type B), it's important to understand how the type names are derived. The type of the message is determined based on the service contract, which can be WSDL or Java.

For WSDL interfaces, the message name is determined based on the fully-qualified element name of a WSDL message.  Take the following WSDL definition:

[source,xml]
----
<definitions xmlns:tns="urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0">  
  <message name="submitOrder">
    <part name="parameters" element="tns:submitOrder"/>
  </message>
  <portType name="OrderService">
    <operation name="submitOrder">
      <input message="tns:submitOrder"/>
    </operation>
  </portType>
</definitions>
----

This would yield the following message type name based on the message element name defined in the WSDL:

[source,java]
----
{urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0}submitOrder
----

When Java interfaces are used for the service contract, the message name consists of the full package name + the class name, prefixed with "java:".

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.example;
public interface OrderService {
    void submitOrder(Order order);
}
----

The message type name for the submitOrder method in this Java interface would be *"java:org.switchyard.example.Order"*.  

Occasionally, it can be useful to override the default operation name generated for a Java interface. The *@OperationTypes* annotation provides this capability by allowing the user to specify the input, output, and/or fault type names used for a Java service interface. 

For example, if we wanted to accept XML input content without any need for transformation to a Java object model, the OrderService interface could be changed to look like this:

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.example;
public interface OrderService {
    @OperationTypes(in = "{urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0}submitOrder")
    void submitOrder(String orderXML);
}
----

Aside from short-circuiting the requirement for transformation, this annotation can be useful if you want to maintain tight control over the names used for message content.

== SwitchYard - Transformations

Required transformations are automatically detected by IDE, but, if missing, can be created/deleted/recreated manually:

image::switchyard/transformers/no_missing_transformer.png[All required validators have been added]

If you remove all/any of the transformers, you will be able to create missing required transformers:

image::switchyard/transformers/required_transformers.png[Create required transformer]

A new dialog will let you create a new transformer:

image::switchyard/transformers/new_transformer_all.png[New Transformer]

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Java
Java transformer let you do any kind of transformation using Java for this purpose. There are two methods available for creating a Java-based transformer in SwitchYard:

1. Implement the *org.switchyard.transform.Transfomer* interface and add a *<transform.java>* definition to your switchyard.xml.
2. Annotate one or more methods on your Java class with *@Transformer*.

 When using the @Transformer annotation, the SwitchYard maven plugin will automatically generate the <transform.java> definition(s) for you and add them to the switchyard.xml packaged in your application.

Implementing Java transformations is just a matter of creating a new (Java) Transformer on the SwitchYard application:

image::switchyard/transformers/new_transformer.png[New validator]

And selecting Java as the type of transformer you want implementing class or bean.

image::switchyard/transformers/new_java_transformer.png[Create a Java transformer]

It will create the appropiate transformer class/bean with the default annotated methods:

image::switchyard/transformers/java_transformer.png[Java Transformer class]

 The optional from and to elements of the @Transformer annotation can be used to specify the qualified type name used during transformer registration.  If not supplied, the full class name of the method parameter will be used as the from type and the full class name of the return type will be used as the to type.

And the corresponding configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::switchyard/transformers/transformer_switchyard_xml.png[Transformers defined in switchyard.xml file]

 The CDI bean name specified by @Named annotation is used to resolve transformer class. If you don't specify, then class name of the transformer is used instead.

== SwitchYard - Transformations - JAXB

The JAXB transformer allows you to perform Java to XML (and XML to Java) transformations using JAXB (XML marshalling and unmarshalling).

 JAXB Java models can be generated from an XML Schema using XJC, or from a WSDL using tools like wsconsume, or from within JBDS IDE with "JAXB`s JAXB classes from Schema" or "SwitchYard`s Java Files from WSDL".

JAXB Transformer requires a *to* and *from* with one Java type and one QNamed XML type, depending on whether you're performing a Java to XML or XML to Java transformation.

[source,java]
----
@XmlElementDecl(namespace = "http://com.acme/orders", name = "create")
public JAXBElement<CreateOrder> createOrder(CreateOrder value) {
    return new JAXBElement<Order>(_CreateOrder_QNAME, CreateOrder.class, null, value);
}
----

And the corresponding configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::switchyard/transformers/jaxb_transformer_switchyard_xml.png[JAXB transformers defined in switchyard.xml file]


== SwitchYard - Transformations - JSON

The JSON transformer provides a basic mapping facility between POJOs and JSON (JSON marshalling and unmarshalling). The JSON specification of the transformer requires a to and from specification with one Java type and one QNamed JSON type, depending on whether you're performing a Java to JSON or JSON to Java transformation.

[source,java]
----
<transforms>
   <xform:transform.json from="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.json.OrderAck" 
                         to="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-json:1.0}orderResponse"/>
   <xform:transform.json from="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-json:1.0}order" 
                         to="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.json.Order"/>
</transforms>
----

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Smooks

There are three distinct transformation models available with Smooks in SwitchYard:

1. XML to Java :  Based on a standard Smooks Java Binding configuration.
2. Java to XML:   Based on a standard Smooks Java Binding configuration.
3. Smooks :  This is a "normal" Smooks transformation in which the developer must define which Smooks filtering Result is to be exported back to the SwitchYard Message as the transformation result.

Smooks transformations are declared by including a <transform.smooks> definition in switchyard.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<transform.smooks config="/smooks/OrderAck_XML.xml"
                  from="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.smooks.OrderAck"
                  to="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-smooks:1.0}submitOrderResponse"
                  type="JAVA2XML"/>
----
The config attribute points to a Smooks resource containing the mapping definition.  The type attribute can be one of SMOOKS, XML2JAVA, or JAVA2XML.

== SwitchYard - Transformations - XSLT

The XSLT transformer allows you to perform a transformation between 2 XML types, using an XSLT. It is configured simply by specifying the to and from QNames, as well as the path to the XSLT to be applied.

[source,xml]

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Validations (Java validations, XML Validation)
Validation feature provides a functionality for message content validation.

* Different implementations for validators:
** Java
** XML
** Other (to be coming...)

We often need to perform message validation before processing its data in service logic, but implementing the validation logic directly in the consumer or provider pollutes the service logic and can lead to tight coupling.  SwitchYard allows for the validation logic to be declared outside the service logic and injected into the mediation layer at runtime.

Validation of message content is specified in the descriptor of your SwitchYard application (switchyard.xml). The qualified name of the type being validated name is defined along with the validator implementation.

== SwitchYard - Java validations

Implementing Java validation is just a matter of creating a new (Java) Validator on the SwitchYard application:

image::switchyard/validators/new_validator.png[New validator]

And selecting type you want to validate and implementing class or bean.

image::switchyard/validators/java_validator.png[Create a Java validator]

It will create the appropiate configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::switchyard/validators/validator_switchyard_xml.png[Validator defined in switchyard.xml file]

And the appropiate class/bean needs to be created (manually), with the correspongin annotations (*@Named* and *@Validator*):

image::switchyard/validators/annotated_validator.png[Annotated validator]

Validation methods should return an instance of *import org.switchyard.validate.ValidationResult*.

There is a helper class for validation called: *org.switchyard.validate.BaseValidator* that provides with methods for *validResult()* and *invalidResult(...)*

== SwitchYard - XML validations

 TODO: Create this

== Configuration (Properties)
SwitchYard supports configuration properties, that can be injected into configuration or into service implementations:

== Switchyard model configuration
SwitchYard allow you to replace any attribute or element value in switchyard.xml with a property from the runtime environment. The syntax for a replaced token is "${varName}" where "varname" is your property name.

== PropertyResolvers (Internals)
The configuration layer in SwitchYard is configured with instances of *PropertyResolver*, which are used to resolve the value of a property based on its name.

* PropertiesPropertyResolver
* TestPropertyResolver
* SystemAndTestPropertyResolver
* CompoundPropertyResolver
* MapPropertyResolver

Creating our custom propertyResolver and registering it in switchyard.xml in switchyard as propertyResolver.
https://github.com/jboss-switchyard/core/blob/master/config/src/main/java/org/switchyard/config/DOMConfiguration.java#L685

TODO: Document this

== Property resolution order
Property values are resolved from the following locations:

* System properties passed by -D option of Java VM like "-Dproperty.name=property.value"
* System environment variables, referenced with an "env." prefix, for example: env.PATH
* Unit test properties
* JBoss AS7 properties, including access into the SecurityVault
* Domain properties in switchyard.xml
* SCA property definitions in the composite or component

The priority in resolving a property is from top to bottom, so a property defined as a System property will always take precedence over a property defined at domain or composite, and a property at domain level will olways take precedence over a property defined at component level.

== Injecting properties into Service Implementation
Implementation properties allow you to inject one or more property values into a service implementation. This is based on the property support in the SCA assembly spec. Since the property is injected into service implementation logic, the injection mechanism itself is unique to each implementation type. The details for each implementation type follow:

* *Java*: injected using @Property into a CDI bean
* *Camel*: wired into Camel properties component and accessible in a Camel route using Camel's own varName property notation
* *BPEL*: mapped into process variables via an <assign> with using resolveProperty() XPath custom function
* *BPMN 2*: inserted into process variables by data input associations
* *Drools*: available in a global map

== Injecting properties in Java Bean implementations
Implementation properties represent environmental properties that you have defined in the SwitchYard application descriptor (switchyard.xml) for your bean implementation. Implementation properties in SwitchYard are the properties that you can configure on a specific service implementation. That is, you can make the property value available to service logic executing inside an implementation container. Here is an example:

[source,xml]
----
<sca:component name="SimpleServiceBean">
      <bean:implementation.bean class="com.example.switchyard.switchyard_example.SimpleServiceBean"/>
      <sca:service name="SimpleService">
        <sca:interface.java interface="com.example.switchyard.switchyard_example.SimpleService">
          <properties>
            <property name="userName" value="${user.name}"/>
          </properties>
        </sca:interface.java>
      </sca:service>
</sca:component>
----

To access the Implementation Properties, add an @Property annotation to your bean class identifying the property you want to inject:

[source,java]
----
@Service(SimpleService.class)
public class SimpleServiceBean implements SimpleService {

  @Property(name="userName")
  private String name;

  @Override
  public String sayHello(String message) {
        return "Hello " + name + ", I got a message: " + message;
    }

}
----

== Injecting Implementation Properties in Camel Routes
SwitchYard integrates with the Properties Component in Camel to make system and application properties available inside your route definitions. You can inject properties into your camel route using {{propertyName}} expression, where propertyName is the name of the property.
For example, the following camel route expects the user.name property to be injected in the last <Log> statement:

[source,xml]
----
<route xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring" id="CamelTestRoute">
    <log message="ItemId [${body}]"/>
    <to uri="switchyard://WarehouseService?operationName=hasItem"/>
    <log message="Title Name [${body}]"/>
    <log message="Properties [{{user.name}}]"/>
</route>
----

== Injecting Implementation Properties in BPEL
You can inject properties into your BPEL process definition with using *SwitchYardPropertyFunction.resolveProperty()* XPath custom function.

This bpel:copy section copies "Greeting" property value into the ReplySayHelloVar variable:

[source,xml]
----
.....
<bpel:copy>
     <bpel:from xmlns:property="java:org.switchyard.component.bpel.riftsaw.SwitchYardPropertyFunction"
                expressionLanguage="urn:oasis:names:tc:wsbpel:2.0:sublang:xpath2.0">
         <![CDATA[concat(property:resolveProperty('Greeting'), $ReceiveSayHelloVar.parameters/tns:input)]]>
     </bpel:from>
     <bpel:to part="parameters" variable="ReplySayHelloVar">
         <bpel:query queryLanguage="urn:oasis:names:tc:wsbpel:2.0:sublang:xpath1.0"><![CDATA[tns:result]]></bpel:query>
     </bpel:to>
</bpel:copy>
----

== Injecting Implementation Properties in BPMN 2
TODO:

== Injecting Implementation Properties in Drools
TODO:

== Invocation properties
While it is a best practice to write your service logic to the data that is defined in the contract (the input and output message types), there can be situations where you need to access contextual information like message headers such as received file name in your implementation. To facilitate this, the Bean component allows you to access the SwitchYard Exchange Context instance associated with a given Bean Service Operation invocation.
Invocation properties represent the contextual information (like message headers) in your bean implementation.

== Accessing Invocation Properties
To enable access to the invocation properties, add a Context property to your bean and annotate it with the CDI @Inject annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Service(SimpleService.class)
public class SimpleServiceBean implements SimpleService {

@Inject
private Context context;

public String sayHello(String message) {
        System.out.println("*** Funky Context Property Value: " + context.getPropertyValue("funkyContextProperty"));
        return "Hi there!!";
    }
}
----
Here, the Context interface allows your bean logic to get and set properties in the context.

NOTE: You can invoke the Context instance only within the scope of one of the Service Operation methods. If you invoke it outside this scope, it results in an UnsupportedOperationException error.

== Domain properties
See package:
org.switchyard.common.property

== Additional info
See: https://community.jboss.org/message/867080

See: https://community.jboss.org/message/819215

See: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/SWITCHYARD/Properties

== Headers and context properties
A service may be configured based on a header or a context property.
TODO: Document how.

== Scope for context properties
Headers and properties are saved in the context with a Scope Label, that identifies the purpose of the header/property.
TODO: Document more.

== TIP Define default value for a property
When we define a property, we can provide a default value, so if the property is not defined by the user it will get this default value. To define this default value, just append to the property name the default value, separated by a colon (:).

[source,bash]
----
${server.port:8080}
----

== TIP Property escaping
Sometimes, the desired value for a property needs to be in the same "dollar curly" syntax which triggers SwitchYard's property substitution. This can be problematic because in these cases, you want SwitchYard to leave the configured value alone. To accomplish this, use a "double dollar curly" syntax instead.

[source,xml]
----
<foo value="${prop}"/>
<bar value="$${prop}"/>
----

Assuming the value "prop" is a resolvable property (say, equal to "test"), the value attribute of the foo element will be that value ("test").  However, the value attribute of the bar element will be "${test}" (with one dollar sign).

== Where to define environment properties
See: https://community.jboss.org/message/868913

== As component properties
Properties can be defined as component property. This way of defining properties is not dynamic, but every properties defined here, can be overriden by properties defined in a "prioritized" scope.

[source, xml]
----
<sy:switchyard ...>
  <sca:composite ...>
    <sca:component ...>
      ...
      <sca:property value="test" name="MY_PROPERTY"/>
    </sca:component>
    <sca:service...>
      ...
    </sca:service>
    <sca:reference ...>
      ...
    </sca:reference>

  </sca:composite>
  ...
</sy:switchyard>
----

== As composite properties
Properties can be defined as composite property. This way of defining properties is not dynamic, but every properties defined here, can be overriden by properties defined in a "prioritized" scope.

[source, xml]
----
<sy:switchyard ...>
  <sca:composite ...>
    <sca:component ...>
      ...
    </sca:component>
    <sca:service...>
      ...
    </sca:service>
    <sca:reference ...>
      <sca:interface.java .../>
      <file:binding.file name="FileBinding">
        <file:directory>/tmp</file:directory>
        <file:fileName>${MY_FILENAME}</file:fileName>
        <file:produce/>
      </file:binding.file>
    </sca:reference>
    <sca:property value="test.txt" name="MY_FILENAME"/>
  </sca:composite>
  ...
</sy:switchyard>
----

== As domain properties
Properties can be defined as composite property. This way of defining properties is not dynamic, but every properties defined here, can be overriden by properties defined in a "prioritized" scope.

[source, xml]
----
<sy:switchyard ...>
  <sca:composite ...>
    <sca:component ...>
      ...
    </sca:component>
    <sca:service...>
      ...
    </sca:service>
    <sca:reference ...>
      ...
    </sca:reference>
  </sca:composite>
  ...
  <sca:domain>
    <sca:property value="test.txt" name="MY_FILENAME"/>
  </sca:domain>
 </sy:switchyard>
----

== In a static module (or dynamic)
NOTE: Right now, it seems that defining properties in static module does not work. They do not get picked up by the property resolvers.
Properties can be externalized from the SwitchYard application it self by defining them outside the switchyard.xml file. One place could be a module. For this to work, you need to define your module:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.0" name="com.examples.switchyard.properties">
    <properties>
        <property name="ftp_server.host" value="localhost"/>
        <property name="ftp_server.port" value="22"/>
    </properties>
</module>
----

And use these properties in your SwitchYard application:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:binding.sftp>
    <ftp:host>${ftp_server.host}</ftp:host>
    <ftp:port>${ftp_server.port}</ftp:port>
   ....
</ftp:binding.sftp>
----

== As OS environment properties
Properties can be loaded from OS environment properties. Every environment property is accesible by prefixing it with *env*.

So a property defined like (in bash):

[source,bash]
----
export MY_PROPERTY=test
----

Can be used in your SwitchYard application:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:binding.sftp>
    <ftp:host>${env.MY_PROPERTY}</ftp:host>
   ....
</ftp:binding.sftp>
----

== As Application Server properties from AS configuration
Application server has the ability to define properties directly in it's configuration (either by file or with the console) and this configuration will be dynamically updated, and persisted.
See: https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossAS7SystemProperties

Adding the following configuration to the definition of the server definition:


[source,xml]
----
<server name="xyz.home" xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:1.0">
    <extensions>
        <extension module="org.jboss.as.clustering.infinispan"/>
        <extension module="org.jboss.as.clustering.jgroups"/>
        <extension module="org.jboss.as.connector"/>
        ....
    </extensions>
    <system-properties>
        <property name="MY_PROPERTY" value="test"/>
    </system-properties>
----

This properties will be used in the same way:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:binding.sftp>
    <ftp:host>${MY_PROPERTY}</ftp:host>
   ....
</ftp:binding.sftp>
----


== As Application Server properties from file
You can pass a properties file as an argument to JBoss AS startup script, and it will load all the properties in the file and make then accesible, so we can start the AS like:

[source,bash]
----
$./standalone.sh -P file:///data/production.properties
----

And this properties will be accesible, as in any other example above.

[source,xml]
----
   <sca:properties file="ftp.properties"/>
----

== TIP How to make endpoints/config dynamic
WARNING: Depending on the binding it is not possible to make endpoints dynamic, due to the endpoint being a property set to the binding at activation time, and not being re-definible. These endpoint that are not dynamic are those based on HTTP transport (http, rest, soap, sca). For other services, endpoints can be altered providing endpoint properties. (Those endpoints whose binding is Camel based. Look at camel docs for this properties)


== SwitchYard - Policies (transaction, )
Policy allows you to control the runtime behavior of a service in a declarative manner, independent of the service implementation and binding details. 

* Configuring policy
* Interaction Policy
* Implementation Policy

 TODO: Create this

== How transactions work in SwitchYard (Internals)
Transactions are handled in the handler chain through which a Exchange flows. 

There is a specific ExchangeHandler for transactions, *org.switchyard.handlers.TransactionHandler*, that interprets transactional policy specified on an exchange and handles transactional requirements.

For transactions to work, there must be a TransactionManager accesible to this handler, so the service must be running in a JEE context.

If no TransactionManager is available at TransactionHandler creation time, a log debug message will be shown. TransactionHandler will be instantiated (created) when deploying a service.

TODO: Is this true??? Or it is created at SwitchYard engine boot up time?

TransactionHandler will be invoked two times per Exchange, before execution and after execution, so a transaction can be *"created, suspended"* and *"terminated, resumed"*.

== TransactionHandler - Before
In the before execution:

* Policies combination is evaluated, and if an incompatible policies is defined, a HandlerException is thrown.
* Transaction status is also checked, so if a transaction is required and there is no transaction in the current invocation a HandlerException is thrown. 
* And then executes the required action for the combination defined, so it *starts a new transaction* or *suspends current transaction*. 
* Failure to start or suspend the transaction will throw a HandlerException with the appropiate message, and a log debug message will be written.
* Once the transaction is suspended/created, the required/provided policies for the Exchange are set in the Exchange context.

== TransactionHandler - After
In the after execution:

* The transaction initiated by this handler (if any) will be terminated (commited or rollbacked)
* and if there is a supended transaction, it will be resumed.

NOTE: Termination function will depend on whatever *javax.transaction.Status* is set on the TransactionManager, if it is Status.STATUS_MARKED_ROLLBACK it will be rollbacked, or if it is Status.STATUS_ACTIVE it will be committed.

* If there is any error while commiting or rollbacking the transaction, a HandlerException will be thrown with the appropiate message and logged accordingly, at debug level.
* If a fault is thrown during the execution of a transaction, TransactionHandler will check for a *rollbackOnFault* property on the exchange, to determine what to do, either commit or rollback. 

NOTE: Default behaviour is to set this property to true in case of an error in the execution of any SwitchYard logic, so the transaction will be *marked* as rollbackOnly, and finalized wherever it was started, with a rollback action.

[source,java]
----
exchange.getContext().getProperty(Exchange.ROLLBACK_ON_FAULT)
----

== TIP Mark a transaction fault as managed
To override this functionality, and be able to commit on a fault, you will need to set this property to false.

TODO: Show example

== SwitchYard Policy properties in Context (Internals)
The set of required and provided policies is carried as an exchange-scoped context property.

* Provided policy represents an assertion that a given policy is satisfied. 
* Required policy represents a requirement that a specific policy must be provided.  

[source,java]
----
Set<Policy> provided = getPolicies(exchange, PolicyUtil.PROVIDED_PROPERTY);
provided.add(policy);
exchange.getContext().setProperty("org.switchyard.policy.provided", provided, Scope.EXCHANGE).addLabels(BehaviorLabel.TRANSIENT.label());
...
Set<Policy> required = getPolicies(exchange, PolicyUtil.REQUIRED_PROPERTY);
required.add(policy);
exchange.getContext().setProperty("org.switchyard.policy.required", required, Scope.EXCHANGE).addLabels(BehaviorLabel.TRANSIENT.label());
----

*PolicyUtil* class have helper/utility methods to set/get policies and to check if a policy is required/provided.

[source,java]
----
PolicyUtil.isRequired(Exchange exchange, Policy policy);
PolicyUtil.isProvided(Exchange exchange, Policy policy);
----

== Transaction policies
The provided Transaction policies are those defined and supported by the link:SCA specification[http://docs.oasis-open.org/opencsa/sca-policy/sca-policy-1.1-spec-csprd03.html#_Toc311121490]

=== Implementation policies
These transaction policies are set at the implementation (components definition) and define the transactiona requirement for the logic contained in the component.

* *managedTransaction.Global*: Uses any existing global transaction propagated from the client or else begins and complete a new global transaction.
* *managedTransaction.Local*: SwitchYard runtime begins and complete a Local Transaction Containment for each Exchange.
* *noManagedTransaction*: SwitchYard runtime doesn't start any transaction. Application has a responsibility to manage the transaction boundaries.

image:switchyard/transactions/implementation_policies.png[Implementation policies]

Implementation policies are set on the component.

=== Interaction policies
These transaction policies are set at the interaction (wire) and defines what logic drives the propagation or not of the existing transactional context.

* *propagatesTransaction*: Any existing transaction should continue and be used during the invocation.
* *suspendsTransaction*: Any existing transaction should be suspended before the invocation takes place.

image:switchyard/transactions/interaction_policies.png[Interaction policies]

Interaction policies are set on the wire, so you need to select the component`s reference.

== TIP What happens when you select None as implementation or interaction policies?
TODO: What happens when you select None as a policy??? Implement and test, and show errors.

== TIP Create at input point (with request)
while SwithYard services will be called through one of it's service bindings, this dictates where is the transaction created. Transactions are first created in the first "wire" after the binding, so, at all effects it will be created as soon as SwitchYard starts executing the service, and before any client code, so eveything that service designers can do will fall into a transaction.
SwitchYard will always start a transaction, if the first component being invoked is configured to:

* Use LocalTransactions
* Use GlobalTransactions and there is not an active transaction yet.

If None is selected, a transaction will not be created.
TODO: Is above sentence true???

== Transaction definitions compatibility

=== Implementation policy: managedTransaction.Local
If a component defines an implementation policy of *managedTransaction.Local*, interaction policy must be set to *suspendsTransaction*, otherwise there will be an error at deployment time.


* *suspendsTransaction*: Container will suspend the ongoing transaction, create a new one, and after execution, commit or rollback the created transaction, and resume the transaction that was suspended.
* *propagatesTransaction*: Error at deployment time.

* *suspendsTransaction*:  (Deploys correctly). Container will suspend the ongoing transaction, create a new one, and after execution, commit or rollback the created transaction, and resume the transaction that was suspended.
* *propagatesTransaction*: (Deploys correctly). Container will use the same transaction as the receiving one.
* *None*: (Deploys correctly) (Behaves???)

==== Implementation policy: noManagedTransaction
If a component defines an implementation policy of *noManagedTransaction*, interaction policy can be set to:

* *suspendsTransaction*:  (Deploys correctly) (Behaves???)
* *propagatesTransaction*: Error at deployment time.

== Transaction propagation
Transaction propagation will be honoured, if defined, for every interaction between service components (if these components are transactional) as well as with external services being called (if these services are called via a transactional resource).

=== Transaction propagation via SCA
TODO: Is this a JTA enabled transactioanl resource? Are transactions propagated between containers?

== Transactional resources
Current transactional resources existing in SwitchYard are:

Implementations::
* Bean
* Camel
* BPMN
* BPEL
* Rules

Bindings::
* SCA
* JMS
* JCA
* JPA
* SQL
* Camel

SwitchYard services can be secured by:

1. Specifying a list of security policies that are required for that service.
2. Configuring application-level security processing details for the services within a domain.
3. Configuring system-level security processing details.
4. Storing sensitive information, such as passwords, in the JBoss AS password vault.

== SwitchYard - Clustering
There are two fundamental building blocks to the clustering support in SwitchYard:

* *Shared Runtime Registry*: a shared, distributed runtime registry which allows individual instances to publish and query service endpoint details.
* *Remote Communication Channels*: an internal communication protocol used to allow a service client to invoke a service hosted in a remote instance.

image::switchyard/clustering.jpg[Clustering]

The runtime registry is backed by a replicated Infinispan cache.  Each instance in a cluster points to the same replicated cache.  When a node joins a cluster, it immediately has access to all remote service endpoints published in the registry.  If a node leaves the cluster due to failure or shutdown, all service endpoint registrations are immediately removed for that node.  The registry is not persisted, so manually clean-up and maintenance is not required.  Note that the shared registry is a runtime registry and not a publication registry, which means the registry's lifecycle and state is tied to the current state of deployed services within a cluster.  This is in contrast to a publication registry (e.g. UDDI), where published endpoints are independent from the runtime state of the ESB.

The communications channel is a private intra-cluster protocol used by instances to invoke a remote service.  The channel is currently based on HTTP, but this may change in the future and should be considered a transparent detail of the clustering support in SwitchYard.

 TODO: REVIEW this

== SwitchYard - Configuring Clustering
Clustering support is light on configuration and should work out of the box.  The only real requirements are using a shared Infinispan cache for the runtime registry and indicating which services are clustered in your application config (switchyard.xml).  By default, SwitchYard uses the default cache in the "cluster" cache container which comes pre-defined in your standalone-ha.xml.  Unless you have specific requirements to use a different cache or separate cache configuration, just stick with the default.

Applications take advantage of clustering by explicitly identifying which services should be clustered in the application's descriptor (switchyard.xml).  You can control which services in your application will be published in the cluster's runtime registry and which references can be resolved by clustered services.  To enable a service to be published in the cluster's runtime registry, promote the service in your application and add a <binding.sca> with clustering enabled to it.

[source,xml]
----
<sca:service name="Goodbye" promote="GoodbyeBean/Goodbye">   
   <sca:interface.java interface="com.example.Goodbye"/>
   <sca:binding.sca sy:clustered="true"/>
</sca:service>
----

Consuming services in a cluster follows the same configuration approach, but applies to references in your application.  To invoke a service in a cluster, promote the reference and add an SCA binding with clustering enabled.

[source,xml]
----
<sca:reference name="Goodbye" multiplicity="0..1" promote="GreetingBean/Goodbye">
   <sca:interface.java interface="com.example.Goodbye"/>
   <sca:binding.sca sy:clustered="true"
</sca:reference>
----

 TODO: REVIEW this

== SwitchYard - Using Clustering
To create a cluster of SwitchYard instances, start two or more AS 7 instances with a shared Infinispan cache.  Out-of-the-box configuration in standalone-ha.xml should be sufficient:

[source,bash]
----
# start instance 1
node1> bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node1
# start instance 2
node2> bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000
----

Once the instances are up, you can deploy applications independently to each instance.  A homogeneous cluster would have identical applications deployed on each node.  A heterogeneous cluster will have different applications and services deployed on each instance. For testing purposes, it's easiest to deploy a consumer application to one instance and a provider application to another.

== SwitchYard - Testing SwitchYard application
SwitchYard provides classes to help you do unit tests with JUnit4 testing framework. 

== SwitchYardRunner
In order to take advantage of the test support in SwitchYard, ensure that your unit test is annotated with the SwitchYardRunner JUnit test Runner class. 

The SwitchYardRunner creates and starts an embedded runtime for each test method.

After the embedded runtime starts, the project containing the test is packaged as a SwitchYard application and deployed to it.

An instance of the SwitchYardTestKit class is injected into the test when a property of type SwitchYardTestKit is declared in the test.

This instance represents the runtime state of the deployed SwitchYard test application.

== SwitchYard JUnit example

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private SwitchYardTestKit testKit;

    @Test
    public void testOperation() {
        MyTestServiceHandler service = new MyTestServiceHandler();

        // register the service...
        testKit.registerInOutService("MyService", service);

        // invoke the service and capture the response...
        Message response = newInvoker("MyService")
        .sendInOut("<create>A1234</create>");

        // test the response content by doing an XML comparison with a
        // file resource on the classpath...
        testKit.compareXMLToResource(response.getContent(String.class), 
                                     "/myservice/expected-create-response.xml");
    }

    private class MyTestServiceHandler implements ExchangeHandler {
        // implement methods....
    }
}
----

== SwitchYardTestKit
SwitchYardTestKit represents the runtime state of the deployed SwitchYard test application.

The SwitchYardTestKit class provides a set of utility methods for performing all sorts of deployment configuration and test operations.

This class gets injected when we use SwitchYardRunner and we have declared an instance of *SwitchYardTestKit* type.

We do not need to add injection annotation to this type.


== SwitchYardTestCaseConfig
The SwitchYardTestCaseConfig annotation is optional.

You can use it control the behavior of the SwitchYardRunner:

=== config 

* Allows the specification of a SwitchYard XML configuration file (switchyard.xml) for the test.
* The SwitchYardRunner will attempt to load the specified configuration from the classpath.
* If it fails to locate the config on the classpath, it will then attempt to locate it on the file system (e.g. within the project structure).

=== mixins

* Enables you to add specific testing tools to your test case.
* Each TestMixIn is a composition-based method that provides customized testing tools for service implementations, gateway bindings, and transformers.
* When a TestMixIn is annotated on a test class, the SwitchYardRunner handles all the initialization and cleanup (lifecycle) of the TestMixIn instances.
* It is also possible to manually create and manage TestMixIn instances within your test class if you are not using the SwitchYardRunner.

=== scanner

* Enables you to add classpath scanning as part of the test lifecycle. This adds the same Scanner behavior as the one available with the SwitchYard maven build plugin.
* It allows the scanning to take place as part of the test lifecycle.
* You may need to add Scanners if you want your test to run inside your IDE. This is because running your test inside your IDE bypasses the whole maven build process, which means the build plugin does not perform any scanning

== SwitchYardTestCaseConfig example

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(config = "testconfigs/switchyard-01.xml", mixins = {CDIMixIn.class}, scanners = {BeanSwitchYardScanner.class, TransformSwitchYardScanner.class})
public class MyServiceTest  {

    @Test
    public void testOperation() {
        newInvoker("OrderService")
        .operation("createOrder")
        .sendInOnly("<order><product>AAA</product><quantity>2</quantity></order>");
    }
}
----

== mixins
The TestMixIn feature allows you to selectively enable additional test functionality based on the capabilities of your application.

To include MixIn support in your application, you must include a Maven dependency in your application's pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.switchyard.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>switchyard-component-test-mixin-name</artifactId>
    <version>release-version</version> <!-- e.g. "1.0" -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Available mixins

* *CDIMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-cdi): boostraps a stand-alone CDI environment, automatically discovers CDI beans, registers bean services, and injects references to SwitchYard services.
* *HTTPMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-http): client methods for testing HTTP-based services.
* *SmooksMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-smooks): stand-alone testing of any Smoooks transformers in your application.
* *HornetQMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-hornetq): bootstraps a stand-alone HornetQ server and provides utility methods to interact with it for testing purpose. It can be also used to interact with remote HornetQ server.
* *JCAMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-jca): bootstraps a embedded IronJacamar JCA container and provides utility methods to interact with it for testing purpose. It has a MockResourceAdapter feature to simulate the SwitchYard application behavior without connecting to the real EIS systems. JCAMixIn has been deprecated. It will be removed from the distribution in the future. JCA testing capabilities also provide wiht a *TransactionMixIn*.
* *NamingMixIn* (switchyard-component-test-mixin-naming): provides access to naming and JNDI services within an application.
* *PropertyMixIn* (switchyard-test): provides ability to set test values to properties that are used within the configuration of the application


== Available scanners

* *BeanSwitchYardScanner*: Scans for CDI Bean Service implementations.
* *TransformSwitchYardScanner*: Scans for Transformers.
* *BpmSwitchYardScanner*: Scans for @Process, @StartProcess, @SignalEvent and @AbortProcessInstance annotations.
* *RouteScanner*: Scans for Camel Routes.
* *RulesSwitchYardScanner*: Scans for @Rule annotations.

== Enabling test support
Adding test support to your SwitchYard application is simply a matter of adding a dependency to the switchyard-test module in your application's pom.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.switchyard</groupId>
    <artifactId>switchyard-test</artifactId>
    <version>[release-version]</version> <!-- e.g. "1.1.1-p5-redhat-1" -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
Note: camel dependency version is 2.10.0.redhat-60024

In addition to a dependency on the core test framework, you might want to take advantage of MixIns in your test classes.

== Metadata and Support Class Injections
Some support classes can be injected into a SwitchYard Junit test by SwitchYardRunner.

== TestKit Injection
Injecting the SwitchYardTestKit instance into the test at runtime is simply a case of declaring a property of that type in the test class.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private SwitchYardTestKit testKit;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== Deployment Injection
You can inject the deployment instance by declaring a property of the type Deployment.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private Deployment deployment;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== SwitchYardModel Injection
You can inject the SwitchYardModel instance by declaring a property of the type SwitchYardModel.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private SwitchYardModel model;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== ServiceDomain Injection
You can inject the ServiceDomain instance by declaring a property of the type ServiceDomain.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private ServiceDomain serviceDomain;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== TransformerRegistry Injection
You can inject the TransformerRegistry instance by declaring a property of the type TransformerRegistry.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private TransformerRegistry transformRegistry;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== TestMixIn Injection
You can inject the TestMixIn Injection instance by declaring a property of the type TestMixIn Injection.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, HTTPMixIn.class})
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private CDIMixIn cdiMixIn;
    private HTTPMixIn httpIn;

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== PropertyMixIn Injection
PropertyMixIn instances are injected like any other TestMixIn type.

NOTE: You must set any properties you wish to use on the MixIn before deployment in order for them to be useed. To do so, use of the *@BeforeDeploy* annotation.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, PropertyMixIn.class, HTTPMixIn.class})
public class MyServiceTest  {

    private PropertyMixIn propMixIn;
    private HTTPMixIn httpMixIn;

    @BeforeDeploy
    public void setTestProperties() {
        propMixIn.set("soapPort", Integer.valueOf(18002));
    }

    // implement test methods...
}
----

== Invoker Injection
To inject Service Invoker instances, declare properties of the type Invoker and annotate them with @ServiceOperation. (Note the annotation value is a dot-delimited Service Operation name of the form [service-name].[operation-name].)

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(config = "testconfigs/switchyard-01.xml")
public class MyServiceTest  {

   @ServiceOperation("OrderService.createOrder")
   private Invoker createOrder;

   @Test
   public void test_createOrder() {
      createOrder.sendInOnly("<order><product>AAA</product><quantity>2</quantity></order>");
   }
}
----

== TIPS: Using harmcrest to assert
Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively.

We can use Hamcrest's *assertThat* construct and the standard set of matchers, both of which can be statically imported.

[source,java]
----
import static org.hamcrest. MatcherAssert .assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest. Matchers .*;
----

Hamcrest comes with a library of useful matchers. Here are some of the most important ones.

* Core
** anything: always matches, useful if you don't care what the object under test is
** describedAs: decorator to adding custom failure description
** is: decorator to improve readability
* Logical
** allOf: matches if all matchers match, short circuits (like Java &&)
** anyOf: matches if any matchers match, short circuits (like Java ||)
** not: matches if the wrapped matcher doesn't match and vice versa
* Object
** equalTo: test object equality using Object.equals
** hasToString: test Object.toString
** instanceOf, isCompatibleType: test type
** notNullValue, nullValue: test for null
** sameInstance: test object identity
* Beans
** hasProperty: test JavaBeans properties
* Collections
** array: test an array's elements against an array of matchers
** hasEntry, hasKey, hasValue: test a map contains an entry, key or value
** hasItem, hasItems: test a collection contains elements
** hasItemInArray: test an array contains an element
* Number
** closeTo: test floating point values are close to a given value
** greaterThan, greaterThanOrEqualTo, lessThan, lessThanOrEqualTo: test ordering
* Text
** equalToIgnoringCase: test string equality ignoring case
** equalToIgnoringWhiteSpace: test string equality ignoring differences in runs of whitespace
** containsString, endsWith, startsWith: test string matching

== Invoke a component service
In order to invoke a component service, a invoker must be injected for certain ServiceOperation.

When injecting a service operation, we must specify it in *"[service_name].[operation_name]"* notation.

[source,java]
----
import org.switchyard.test.Invoker;
...

@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(mixins = CDIMixIn.class)
public class ExampleServiceTest {

   @ServiceOperation("ExampleService.submitOperation")
   private Invoker submitOperation;

   @Test
   public void testOK() throws Exception {
      ParamIn testParam = new ParamIn().set...(...);

      ParamOut result = submitOperation.sendInOut(testParam)
                                       .getContent(ParamOut.class);

      Assert....
   }

   @Test
   public void testForFault() throws Exception {
      ParamIn testParam = new ParamIn().set...(...);

      try{
         // This method invocation should throw a fault
         ParamOut result = submitOperation.sendInOut(testParam)
                                          .getContent(ParamOut.class);

         Assert.fail();
      } catch (InvocationFaultException ifex){
         Assert.... // Assert for correct type of exception
      }
   }
}
----

== TIP Checking for exceptions
An invocation to a service operation can throw a *InvocationFaultException* whenever the method should throw a fault. So catching this exception is similar to validating for the fault being trhown. We will check against original exception, checking the type of the InvocationFaultException

[source,java]
----
ifex.isType(MyOriginalException.class)
----

Or we can use the provided functionality by JUnit setting the expected exception in the test

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=org.switchyard.test.InvocationFaultException.class)
----

== Use SwitchYardTestKit utility methods to ease testing
TestKit provides with a set of utility methods to ease validations and some common operations that are performed on test classes.

* Access to underlyings
** *getTestInstance*:
** *getActivators*:
** *getDeployment*:
** *getServiceDomain*:
** *createQName*:

* Service manipulation
** *registerInOutService*:
** *registerInOnlyService*:
** *removeService*:
** *replaceService*:

* Invocation
** *newInvoker*:

* Transformations
** *addTransformer*:
** *newTransformer*:
** *registerTransformer*:

* MixIns
** *getMixIns*:
** *getMixIn*:

* Dependencies
** *getRequiredDependencies*:
** *getOptionalDependencies*:

* Resources
** *getResourceAsStream*:
** *readResourceBytes*:
** *readResourceString*: Reads a resource (file) form the classpath
** *readResourceDocument*:

* Configruation
** *loadSwitchYardModel*:
** *loadConfigModel*:

* XML Comparisson
** *compareXMLToResource*: Compares a XML in string format with a XML file in the classpath.
** *compareXMLToString*:

* Tracing
** *traceMessages*: enables message tracing for the application under test.

== TIP Test for transformations in component service
When we test a component invocation, we can test for the appropiate transformation with additional methods on the invocation, for the input transformation as well as for the output transformation:

[source,java]
----
...

@ServiceOperation("ExampleService.submitOperation")
private Invoker serviceOperationInvocation;

@Test
public void testForInputTransformation() throws Exception {
   ParamOut result =  serviceOperationInvocation
                        .inputType(
                           QName.valueOf("{urn:com.example:service:1.0"}submitOperation))
                        .sendInOut(....)
                        .getContent(ParamOut.class);
   Assert....  // Assert that result is OK, so transformation was OK
}

@Test
public void testForOutputXMLTransformation() throws Exception {
   ParamIn testParam = new ParamIn().set...(...);

   ParamOut result = serviceOperationInvocation
                        expectedOutputType(
                           QName.valueOf("{urn:com.example:service:1.0"}submitOperationResponse))
                     .sendInOut(testParam)
                     .getContent(Element.class); // Expect XML Element from transformation

   XMLAssert....  // Assert that result is what is expected
}
----
NOTE: We can use XMLUnit and XMLAssert from *org.custommonkey.xmlunit* to ease validations.

== TIP Test for transformations in component service using HTTPMixIn

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
        scanners = TransformSwitchYardScanner.class,
        mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, HTTPMixIn.class})
public class WebServiceTest {

   private HTTPMixIn httpMixIn;

   @Test

   }
}
----

== TIP Test for validations in component service
When we test a component invocation, validations will be tested (as were tested transformations) with an invocation to the TestInvoker, as shown in the previous example.

[source,java]
----
...

@ServiceOperation("ExampleService.submitOperation")
private Invoker serviceOperationInvocation;

@Test
public void testForMessageValidation() throws Exception {

                     .getContent(ParamOut.class);
   Assert....  // Assert that result is OK, so validation was OK
}
----

== TIP Test for validations in component service using HTTPMixin
You can also use HTTPMixIn for testing validations.

NOTE: You have to add the ValidateSwitchYardScanner scanner

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
        scanners = ValidateSwitchYardScanner.class,
        mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, HTTPMixIn.class})
public class WebServiceTest {

   private HTTPMixIn httpMixIn;

                                       "/xml/soap-response.xml");
   }
}
----

== TIP Mock a service, component or reference
Sometimes it is useful to mock a component, so it is never invoked for the shake of a test. 
For this, SwitchYardTestKit provides with the ability of adding, replacing or removing services.

[source,java]
----
    // replace existing implementation for testing purposes
    testKit.removeService("MyService");
    final MockHandler myService = testKit.registerInOnlyService("MyService");

    .... // Invoke the service under test

    // Assert what has arrived ath the mocked service
    final LinkedBlockingQueue<Exchange> recievedMessages = myService.getMessages();
    assertThat(recievedMessages, is(notNullValue()));

    final Exchange recievedExchange = recievedMessages.iterator().next();
    assertThat(recievedExchange.getMessage().getContent(String.class), is(equalTo(...)));

----

When we want to assert what has arrived/produced the MockHandler, we can get:

* getMessages(): This provides with the list of received messages.
* getFaults(): This provides with the list of produced faults.

Sometimes service is InOut, so we need to mock a response. There are four options:

* forwardInToOut()
* forwardInToFault()
* replyWithOut(Object)
* replyWithFault(Object)

[source,java]
----
    final MockHandler mockHandler = testKit.registerInOutService("MyService");
    mockHandler.forwardInToOut();
----

We can also instruct the MockHandler to wait for certain message.

* waitForOkMessage()
* waitForFaultMessage()

It will wait for 5 seconds (default) unless instructed to wait for a different period with *setWaitTimeout(milis)*

== TIP Mock a service for more than 1 method invocation
There are some cases where the service we are mocking is being called two times in the context of a single unit test,
maybe multiple calls to the same method, or to different methods.
For this particular case, we can register an *ExchangeHandler* with the mock,
while registering and replacing the original service, that will get the message, and where
we will have to put some logic to deal with this scenario.

[source,java]
----
    testKit.replaceService(qname, new ExchangeHandler() {

        @Override
        public void handleMessage(Exchange arg0) throws HandlerException {
            // Here logic to handle with messages

        @Override
        public void handleFault(Exchange arg0) throws HandlerException {
            // Here logic to handle with faults
        }
    });
----

If this ExchangeHandler needs to be reused, of course, can be made a named class (not anonymous).

== TIP MockHandler for testing one method multiple invocations
In this scenario, the ExchangeHandler needs to keep track of which invocation number it was in case has to answer with different messages

[source,java]
----
testKit.replaceService(qname, new ExchangeHandler() {
   int call=1;

   @Override
   public void handleMessage(Exchange exchange) throws HandlerException {
      if (call++ == 1){ // First call
         // Do whatever wants to be done as result of this operation call, 
         // and return the expected output
         Result result = ...; / Result is return type for operation store
         exchange.send(exchange.createMessage().setContent(result));
      }else if (call++ == 2){ // Second call
         // Do whatever wants to be done as result of this operation call, 
         // and return the expected output
         Result result = ...; / Result is return type for operation store

      }
   }

   @Override
   public void handleFault(Exchange exchange) throws HandlerException {
      // Here logic to handle with faults
   }
});
----

== TIP MockHandler for testing different methods
In this scenario, the ExchangeHandler used will have to check for operation name, to know which method is being invoked.


[source,java]
----
testKit.replaceService(qname, new ExchangeHandler() {

   @Override
   public void handleMessage(Exchange exchange) throws HandlerException {
      if (exchange.getContract().getProviderOperation().getName().equals("store")){
         // Do whatever wants to be done as result of this operation call, 
         // and return the expected output
         Result result = ...; / Result is return type for operation store
         exchange.send(exchange.createMessage().setContent(result));
      }else if (exchange.getContract().getProviderOperation().getName().equals("getId")){
         // Do whatever wants to be done as result of this operation call, 
         // and return the expected output
         exchange.send(exchange.createMessage().setContent(1)); // This operation returns a Int
      }else{
         throw new HandlerException("No operation with that name should be executed");
      }
   }

   @Override
   public void handleFault(Exchange exchange) throws HandlerException {
      // Here logic to handle with faults
   }
});

== TIP How to add credentials before invoking a Service
When there is a service that uses credentials for routing or logic, we need to inject this credentials also in testing, so we do not need to modify our application logic.
To do so, we can add the required credentials to the invocation before calling the actual service.

NOTE: It is a hack for SwitchYard version 1.1 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SWITCHYARD-2031)

[source,java]
----
    protected SecurityContextManager securityMgr;

    @Before
    public void onCreate() {
        securityMgr = new SecurityContextManager(testKit.getServiceDomain());
    }

    ...
    service.operation("deleteEnterprises").sendInOut(addCredentials(message))
                .getContent(DeleteEnterpriseResponse.class);
    ...

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private <T> T addCredentials(T request) {
        AuthenticationWrapper wrapper = new AuthenticationWrapper();
        testKit.registerInOutService("AuthenticationWrapper", wrapper);
        QName serviceName = new QName(ObjectFactory.NAME_SPACE, "AuthenticationWrapper");
        Invoker service = new Invoker(testKit.getServiceDomain(), serviceName);
        return (T) service.operation("").sendInOut(request).getContent();
    }

    private class AuthenticationWrapper implements ExchangeHandler {

       @Override
        public void handleMessage(Exchange exchange) throws HandlerException {
            Set<Credential> credentials = new HashSet<Credential>();
            credentials.add(new NameCredential(USERNAME));
            securityMgr.addCredentials(exchange, credentials);
            exchange.send(exchange.getMessage().copy());
        }

        @Override
        public void handleFault(Exchange exchange) {
        }
    }
----

== TIP Invoke a remote service
When a service is published with an SCA binding, we can invoke it remotely with a Remote Invoker.

[source,java]
----
    public static void main(final String[] ignored) throws Exception {
        // Create a new remote client invoker
        RemoteInvoker invoker = new HttpInvoker("http://localhost:8080/switchyard-remote");

        // Create request payload
        ParamIn input = ...;

        // Create the request message
        RemoteMessage message = new RemoteMessage();
        message.setService(new QName(
            "urn:com.example:1.0","MyService"))
            .setOperation("myOperation").setContent(input);

        // Invoke the service
        RemoteMessage reply = invoker.invoke(message);
        if (reply.isFault()) {
            ...
        } else {
            ParamOut output = (ParamOut)reply.getContent();
            ...
        }
    }
----

== Testing a deployed service with HTTPMixin
Whenever we want to test a deployed service, we can use HTTPMixin to create all the required wishtles.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        scanners = TransformSwitchYardScanner.class,
        mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, HTTPMixIn.class})
public class WebServiceTest {

    private HTTPMixIn httpMixIn;

    @Test
    public void invokeWebService() throws Exception {
        // Use the HttpMixIn to invoke the SOAP binding endpoint with a SOAP input (from the test classpath)
        // and compare the SOAP response to a SOAP response resource (from the test classpath)...
        httpMixIn.setContentType("application/soap+xml");
        httpMixIn.postResourceAndTestXML("http://localhost:18001/service-context/ServiceName", "/xml/soap-request.xml", "/xml/soap-response.xml");
    }
}
----

Or from a main class:

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Only execution point for this application.
     * @param ignored not used.
     * @throws Exception if something goes wrong.
     */
    public static void main(final String[] ignored) throws Exception {

        HTTPMixIn soapMixIn = new HTTPMixIn();
        soapMixIn.initialize();

        try {
            String result = soapMixIn.postFile(URL, XML);
            System.out.println("SOAP Reply:\n" + result);
        } finally {
            soapMixIn.uninitialize();
        }
    }
----

== Creating an Embedded WebService to test a component
In some situations we only want to test a component, so we decide to expose it dynamically as a WebService an invoke it.

[source,java]
----
import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;
...

@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
        scanners = {TransformSwitchYardScanner.class},
        mixins = {HTTPMixIn.class})
public class CamelSOAPProxyTest {

    private static final String WEB_SERVICE = "http://localhost:8081/MyService";

    private HTTPMixIn _http;
    private Endpoint _endpoint;

    @BeforeDeploy
    public void setProperties() {
        System.setProperty("org.switchyard.component.http.standalone.port", "8081");
    }

    @Before
    public void startWebService() throws Exception {
        _endpoint = Endpoint.publish(WEB_SERVICE, new ReverseService());
    }

    @After
    public void stopWebService() throws Exception {
        _endpoint.stop();
    }

    @Test
    public void testWebService() throws Exception {
        _http.postResourceAndTestXML(WEB_SERVICE, "/xml/soap-request.xml", "/xml/soap-response.xml");
    }
}
----

== Testing a deployed service with HornetQMixIn
Sometimes we need to test an application that has a JMS binding and we want to test with the binding itself. For these use cases, HornetQMixIn comes to the rescue.

HornetQMixIn gets its configuration from 2 files that has to be on the classpath for the test:

*hornetq-configuration.xml*: Contains the configuration for the HornetQ server.

[source,xml]
----
 <configuration xmlns="urn:hornetq">

        <paging-directory>target/data/paging</paging-directory>
        <bindings-directory>target/data/bindings</bindings-directory>

   </queue>
   <queue name="TestReplyQueue">
      <entry name="TestReplyQueue"/>
   </queue>

</configuration>
----

To use it in test, you only need to get a reference to the MixIn and use the appropiate mixin methods:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
        mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, HornetQMixIn.class}
)

public class JmsBindingTest {

    private HornetQMixIn _hqMixIn;


    @Test
    public void testHelloService() throws Exception {
        Session session = _hqMixIn.getJMSSession();
        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(HornetQMixIn.getJMSQueue(REQUEST_NAME));
        Message message = _hqMixIn.createJMSMessage(createPayload(NAME));
        producer.send(message);

        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(HornetQMixIn.getJMSQueue(REPLY_NAME));
        message = consumer.receive(3000);
        String reply = _hqMixIn.readStringFromJMSMessage(message);
        SwitchYardTestKit.compareXMLToString(reply, createExpectedReply(NAME));
    }

    @Before
    public void getHornetQMixIn() {
        _hqMixIn = _testKit.getMixIn(HornetQMixIn.class);
    }
----

Or testing from a standalone client:

[source,java]
----
   public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {

        HornetQMixIn hqMixIn = new HornetQMixIn(false)
                                    .setUser(USER)
                                    .setPassword(PASSWD);
        hqMixIn.initialize();

        try {
            Session session = hqMixIn.getJMSSession();
            final MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(HornetQMixIn.getJMSQueue(REQUEST_NAME));
            producer.send(hqMixIn.createJMSMessage("<....>");
            System.out.println("Message sent. Waiting for reply ...");

            final MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(HornetQMixIn.getJMSQueue(REPLY_NAME));
            Message message = consumer.receive(3000);
            String reply = hqMixIn.readStringFromJMSMessage(message);
            System.out.println("REPLY: \n" + reply);
        } finally {
            hqMixIn.uninitialize();
        }

    }
----

== Testing a deployed service with TransactionMixIn
To test your required services with a transaction, we can use TransactionMixIn. TransactionMixIn with combination of CDIMixIn will inject a UserTransaction object when required. If you need explicit access, you can @Inject the UserTransaction object, but if not, it will be injected in SwitchYard's functionalities for you under the covers. This MixIn introduces NamingMixIn for you, as it is a required dependency.

[source,java]
----
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
    config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
    mixins = {CDIMixIn.class, TransactionMixIn.class}
)
public YourClass{
    ....
}
----

And it will bind following objects into the JNDI tree:

* *TransactionManager*: "java:jboss/TransactionManager"
* *UserTransaction*: "java:jboss/UserTransaction"
* *TransactionSynchronizationRegistry*: "java:jboss/TransactionSynchronizationRegistry"

If you need access to the provided objects, you can use the MixIn to get a reference:

[source,java]
----
    private TransactionMixIn transaction;
    ....
    transaction.getUserTransaction();
    transaction.getTransactionManager();
    transaction.getSynchronizationRegistry();
----

This mixin will leave transactional logs in "target/tx-store".

This mixin uses Arjuna Transactions Provider (com.arjuna.ats.jta).

== Testing JPA functionality

TODO:
See: ./quickstarts/camel-jpa-binding/src/test/java/org/switchyard/quickstarts/camel/jpa/binding/CamelJpaBindingTest.java

== Testing in a container with Arquillian

TODO:

== TIP Running REST, SOAP or HTTP endpoint in different ports

For Rest and Http bindings set the following properties in the JUnit test:

[source, java]
----
    @BeforeDeploy
    public void setProperties() {
        System.setProperty("org.switchyard.component.http.standalone.port", "8081");
        System.setProperty("org.switchyard.component.resteasy.standalone.port", "8081"); 
    }
----

For SOAP bindings, set socketAddr in the switchyard.xml

[source,xml]
----
        <service name="OrderService" promote="OrderService">
            <interface.wsdl interface="wsdl/OrderService.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(OrderService)"/>
            <binding.soap xmlns="urn:switchyard-component-soap:config:1.0">
                <wsdl>wsdl/OrderService.wsdl</wsdl>
                <socketAddr>:9091</socketAddr>
                <contextPath>quickstart-bean</contextPath>
            </binding.soap>
        </service>
----

NOTE: You can externilize this properties, and define them in maven to avoid collisions.

WARNING: If you have a running SwitchYard server, and want to do JUnit test for some bindings, some ports may collide. Use this port redefinition to avoid it.

== TIP Testing with a different (reduced) Switchyard configuration file
Use this annotation on the test class:

[source,java]
----
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(config = "switchyard-XXXXX.xml", mixins = {.....})
----

And create your reduced switchyard-XXXX.xml within the test/resources folder at the same package level as your test class.

== TIP Selectively enabling activators for a Test
The test framework defaults to a mode where the entire application descriptor is processed during a test run. This means all gateway bindings and service implementations are activated during each test. There are times when this may not be appropriate, so we allow activators to be selectively enabled or disabled based on your test configuration.
In this example, SOAP bindings are excluded from all tests. (This means that SOAP gateway bindings will not be activated when the test framework loads the application.)

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(config = "testconfigs/switchyard-01.xml" exclude="soap")
public class NoSOAPTest  {
   ...
}
----

This example includes only CDI bean services as defined in the application descriptor:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(config = "testconfigs/switchyard-02.xml" include="bean")
public class BeanServicesOnlyTest  {
...
}
----

== TIP Testing a camel binding
In an scenario where you are exposing services with a camel binding, you can test it getting the CamelContext and then creating a ProducerTemplate.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SwitchYardRunner.class)
@SwitchYardTestCaseConfig(
        config = SwitchYardTestCaseConfig.SWITCHYARD_XML,
        mixins = { CDIMixIn.class })
public class ExampleTest {

    private SwitchYardTestKit testKit;

    @Test
    public void testIntake() throws Exception {
        ServiceDomain domain = testKit.getServiceDomain();
        CamelContext ctx = (CamelContext)domain.getProperty("CamelContextProperty");
        ProducerTemplate producer = ctx.createProducerTemplate();
        producer.sendBody("direct://HelloService", "Message content");
    }
}
----

You can test a service like the one defined below that has a camel binding.

[source,java]
----
<sca:service name="Hello/HelloService" promote="Hello/HelloService">
   <sca:interface.java interface="org.jboss.example.ExampleService"/>
   <camel_1:binding.uri name="camel1" configURI="direct://HelloService"/>
</sca:service>
----

== Preparing procedure for test
Sometimes we need to add some procedures before test is performed. JUnit @Before operation is invoked right after the application is deployed, however, it can't be used if you expect something before deploy. We have @BeforeDeploy annotation for this purpose.

== TIP Testing a Web Service with Policies defined in it or a SOAP CXF interceptor
If you need to do unit testing for a service with policies defined in it, or a custom SOAP cxf interceptor, you will not be able to do it at the moment unless you run the tests against a real "running" container.
