For policies:
* AbstractExchangeValidator extends ExchangeInterceptor: This class observes exchanges and uses the information to create activity events to be validated
* ExchangeInterceptors allow code to be injected around specific interactions in the core exchange bus via a target definition. Valid targets are documented as constant fields in this interface
